<blockquote>
  <p>“This project is part of my coursework in the university.
Here, I performed sentiment analysis by using a pre-trained model to predict the sentiment that indicate whether the customer being satisfied or not from the service. I will be working with a data set, Amazon Fine Food Reviews, which provide attribute such as review comment, summary, score, profilename etc. With that, I might choose only some atrribute and split them into training set and testing set. In the end, I would show the accuracy rate of my model and some challenge for develop the efficientcy of model in the future.”</p>

They are roasted much like coffee beans, and even have a somewhat similar nutty flavor, in addition to being chocolatey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like dark chocolate and you like it crunchy with nibs, this is one of the best.  It's like the gourmet version of a Nestle Crunch bar.  The nibs are evenly distributed at a density level that adds the perfect crunch without being overbearing, and provides a snap of darkness that contrasts somewhat with the sweetness of the chocolate in which they are embedded.  My other favorite from Endangered Species is the 88% dark panther bar.  This one is a little sweeter than that, since it's only 72% cacao, so it should be more palatable to people who find that level of darkness to be a bit too much.</td>

Though the finished product is very dense and not as sweet as the traditional Jiffy Corn Muffin, if you have gluten intolerance, you will find this to be an adequate replacement.  It does offer lactose free directions (a common condition for those recently diagnosed with celiac)which is my usual prep method.  The only drawback of the lactose free version is the oil tends to separate from the batter as it bakes, but does not effect the overall quality of the finished product.  Leftovers should be refrigerated, and reheated in the microwave for best taste.</td>

<h1 id="data-preprocessing">Data Preprocessing</h1>

<p>Now, we will perform some pre-processing on the data before converting it into vectors and
passing it to the machine learning model.<br /></p>

<p>Objective: To reduce noise, which affect the accuracy rate of model prediction. Make it more simple for model to classify.<br /></p>

<p>Method:<br />
1) Using regular expresiion to get rid off any characters which are not alphabet and unnecssary<br />
2) convert the string to lowercase<br />
3) get rid off stopwords i.e ‘the’, ‘an’, ‘to’; these are considres as noise which could make a model less precise<br />
4) lemmatization: chang different form of word i.e. working -&gt; work <br /></p>

It toasts well and easily makes grilled sandwiches delicious.  The nutritional content is as follows :  1 slice is 140 calories, no saturated or trans fats, total fat 2 grams.  Cholesterol 20 mg, sodium 190 mg, total carb ( for one huge slice ) is 29 grams, fiber 1 gram , sugars 1 gram , protein 2 grams.  This has definetly a great sour dough flavor and is not gritty like other gluten free baked goods from other bakeries..I only wish the shipping costs were less with this and all other gluten free baked goods.</td>

      <td>I don't have a gluten intolerance - just trying to cut back on the intake of wheat/gluten...and sugar, but that's another story;) so my body feels less bloated, unhealthy and lethargic due to wheat.  With that said, I do know the differences in taste between wheat pastas, rice, quinoa, corn...etc.  Personally, I have come to love the taste of non-wheat pastas over wheat, with the exception of corn flour, which isn't similar enough to wheat to fool my taste buds.  Annie's does a fantastic job with this rice flour product, giving it a consistency and flavor akin to Kraft mac and cheese.  What makes this better is the cheese, which tastes far yummier than any boxed mac &amp; cheese I have ever had.  Also, it's real cheese, with as few bizarre ingredients as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like to see ingredients, here is a comparison (and please note I am not a nutritionist - just writing a friendly review:):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese:&lt;br /&gt;Cheese sauce mix ingredients: whey (milk protein), milk protein concentrate, milk, milkfat and cheese culture, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate and calcium phosphate, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid and enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie's Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar: cheddar cheese (cultured pasturized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), whey, buttermilk, salt, cream, natural flavor, natural sodium phosphate, annatto extract for natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*wiki annatto extract: Annatto coloring is produced from the reddish pericarp or pulp which surrounds the seed of the achiote (Bixa orellana L.). It is used in many natural cheeses (e.g., Cheddar, Red Leicester, Gouda (cheese) and Brie), margarine, butter, rice, smoked fish, and custard powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie's also has less sodium and sugars, which I am grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Annie's does make another rice pasta mac and cheese - it's a deluxe box.  This is what I would compare to Velveeta - for you lovers out there.  It's the ooey gooey cheese that is thicker.  Personally, I detest Velveeta, so the deluxe isn't as awesome as the simple Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar.  But the deluxe IS better than macaroni with Velveeta because the consistency of the cheese isn't ridiculous overbearing and throat-clogging as Velveeta.  I swear, I always felt like I would suffocate eating that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to those with allergies, and intolerance, or those like myself who are looking for ways to significantly reduce heat intake.  My entire family has now switched from Kraft over to this product (and they didn't do it for health reasons - they simply prefer the taste!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a bit more pricey, I'll give you that.  But for a hint - do check Target occasionally.  They sell Annie's pastas and some amazing organic bunny fruit snacks - all of which go on sale quite often (I just purchased Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar for $1 a box!)  If only the prices were always so kind;)</td>

When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent.  The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine.  When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug's worth of water, and made a cup.  When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk.  Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee.  For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand.  Some other things I love about this brand:  it's organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That's a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup.  The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs.  This is a good deal.  The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment.</td>

<p>do the visualization with heatmap 
Assumption: different score review should have different position in vector space so we will 
utilize heat map to answer the question that the reviews with different range of score are really different in vector space</p>

<h3 id="a-short-note-of-what-is-word-embedding">A short note of what is Word Embedding</h3>
<p>Word Embedding
Word Embeddings are the texts converted into numbers and there may be different numerical representations of the same text
In short, we can say that to build any model in machine learning or deep learning, the final level data has to be in numerical form because models don’t understand text or image data directly as humans do.
Therefore, Vectorization or word embedding is the process of converting text data to numerical vectors. Later those vectors are used to build various machine learning models. In this manner, we say this as extracting features with the help of text with an aim to build multiple natural languages, processing models, etc. We have different ways to convert the text data to numerical vectors which we will discuss in this article later.
Broadly, we can classified word embeddings into the following two categories:
Frequency-based or Statistical based Word Embedding
Prediction based Word Embedding</p>

<p>After some kind of transforming text to vector, we need to reshape sparse matrix
so we can use a coins_similarity function to generate its cosine similarity.
Cosine Similarity is one of the method to measure the distance of different data points in vector space
and , in our case, we will implement that and visualize cosine similarity of those reviews with heat map.</p>

It toasts well and easily makes grilled sandwiches delicious.  The nutritional content is as follows :  1 slice is 140 calories, no saturated or trans fats, total fat 2 grams.  Cholesterol 20 mg, sodium 190 mg, total carb ( for one huge slice ) is 29 grams, fiber 1 gram , sugars 1 gram , protein 2 grams.

      <td>I don't have a gluten intolerance - just trying to cut back on the intake of wheat/gluten...and sugar, but that's another story;) so my body feels less bloated, unhealthy and lethargic due to wheat.  With that said, I do know the differences in taste between wheat pastas, rice, quinoa, corn...etc.  Personally, I have come to love the taste of non-wheat pastas over wheat, with the exception of corn flour, which isn't similar enough to wheat to fool my taste buds.  Annie's does a fantastic job with this rice flour product, giving it a consistency and flavor akin to Kraft mac and cheese.  What makes this better is the cheese, which tastes far yummier than any boxed mac &amp; cheese I have ever had.  Also, it's real cheese, with as few bizarre ingredients as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like to see ingredients, here is a comparison (and please note I am not a nutritionist - just writing a friendly review:):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese:&lt;br /&gt;Cheese sauce mix ingredients: whey (milk protein), milk protein concentrate, milk, milkfat and cheese culture, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate and calcium phosphate, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid and enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie's Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar: cheddar cheese (cultured pasturized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), whey, buttermilk, salt, cream, natural flavor, natural sodium phosphate, annatto extract for natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*wiki annatto extract: Annatto coloring is produced from the reddish pericarp or pulp which surrounds the seed of the achiote (Bixa orellana L.). It is used in many natural cheeses (e.g., Cheddar, Red Leicester, Gouda (cheese) and Brie), margarine, butter, rice, smoked fish, and custard powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie's also has less sodium and sugars, which I am grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Annie's does make another rice pasta mac and cheese - it's a deluxe box.  This is what I would compare to Velveeta - for you lovers out there.  It's the ooey gooey cheese that is thicker.  Personally, I detest Velveeta, so the deluxe isn't as awesome as the simple Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar.  But the deluxe IS better than macaroni with Velveeta because the consistency of the cheese isn't ridiculous overbearing and throat-clogging as Velveeta.  I swear, I always felt like I would suffocate eating that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to those with allergies, and intolerance, or those like myself who are looking for ways to significantly reduce heat intake.  My entire family has now switched from Kraft over to this product (and they didn't do it for health reasons - they simply prefer the taste!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a bit more pricey, I'll give you that.  But for a hint - do check Target occasionally.  They sell Annie's pastas and some amazing organic bunny fruit snacks - all of which go on sale quite often (I just purchased Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar for $1 a box!)  If only the prices were always so kind;)</td>

When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent.  The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine.  When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug's worth of water, and made a cup.  When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk.  Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee.  For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand.  Some other things I love about this brand:  it's organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That's a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup.  The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs.  This is a good deal.  The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment.</td>
