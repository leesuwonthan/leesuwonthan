Here, I performed sentiment analysis by using a pre-trained model to predict the sentiment that indicate whether the customer being satisfied or not from the service. I will be working with a data set, Amazon Fine Food Reviews, which provide attribute such as review comment, summary, score, profilename etc. With that, I might choose only some atrribute and split them into training set and testing set. In the end, I would show the accuracy rate of my model and some challenge for develop the efficientcy of model in the future. . #the dataset: Amazon Fine Food Reviews import pandas as pd import numpy as np import seaborn as sns from wordcloud import WordCloud import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import datetime as dt import datetime import nltk from nltk.corpus import stopwords from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer import re .

I gave it to my wife to try before I would force myself to try it. She looked like a little kid that just tasted soda for the first time. This stuff is so good, tastes like you&#39;re drinking straight out of a coconut without spending an hour opening it. The pulp makes it that much better. I could see this taking the place of a soda drinker pretty easily. SO GOOD. | 5 | . 1 1343520000 | K. Nealon &quot;K.

Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said &quot;Dark Chocolate&quot; so I ordered it. Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too. It showed up as &quot;Dark Hot&quot; when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate. Nope. Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work. Not the same thing at all even though it says &quot;Dark Chocolate&quot; (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12. I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store. But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside. | 1 | . 3 1281657600 | Jay Roberts &quot;Jay&quot; | Excellent Product | I originally purchased the smaller version of this product but upgraded to this version. It was 3/4 full of flies and I ended up throwing it away after maggots started appearing. It&#39;s pretty gross but very effective. I highly recommend purchasing more than one rather than re-using it. | 5 | . 4 1273104000 | Montana Rod &quot;Red Rooster&quot; | kids food | not as good as cheerio&#39;s but a lot cheaper. however, I will order cheerio&#39;s next time and buy these in bulk from the store. | 3 | . ... ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | . 113686 1317686400 | Richard Franco | Avoid this flavor | My daughter gobbles puffs up like they&#39;re manna from heaven... &quot;Puff&quot; is one of the first words she attempted to say... But this particular flavor she has totally rejected. She gets furious when I try to feed her this, as if I&#39;m trying to fool her by giving her something that resembles her beloved puffs but tastes like rubber. | 1 | . 113687 1294531200 | Mom of three | My family doesn&#39;t like it | This is only the second time I have purchased pure maple syrup. The first I bought at the grocery store; it was a grade A. It lacked much maple flavor. So I bought this grade B syrup, thinking the stronger flavor would be better liked. We hate it. It has a very bitter after taste. I don&#39;t know what to do now becuase we don&#39;t like the grade B, but the grade A isn&#39;t strong enough in flavor. | 2 | . 113688 1246492800 | Sara-s | Refreshing and not too sweet | This is a nice, refreshing carbonated drink. It has no added sugar, as advertised. But its name is a bit misleading. The &quot;Orange Tangerine&quot; also has some apple and grape juice added. The grape is not a great addition to the blend, so I wasn&#39;t thrilled with the flavor. | 4 | . 113689 1296345600 | Alex &quot;AG&quot; | Too much sediment | I do love Stash Honeybush but the tea bag version. I thought I&#39;ll give the lose tea a try. The tea leaves are cut TOO SMALL! The sediment is everywhere. I have to strain it 3 times. I&#39;m definitely not getting this again. | 1 | . 113690 1221091200 | Jennifer Jackson &quot;bargain hunter&quot; | Excellent! | When I first got this tea along with the diet raspberry flavor, I was hoping to find an instant tea that tasted a little bit better than other brand diet ones. This went above and beyond my expectations! I&#39;ve tried other diet teas and they seem to all have a distinct &quot;diet&quot; taste. These teas are great, very good flavor, no diet aftertaste! I can&#39;t decide if I like the raspberry or peach flavor better, both are very good. You can&#39;t even tell it&#39;s diet, you get that little pleasure of your tastebuds thinking they&#39;re getting the sugar, lol. | 5 | . 113691 rows × 5 columns . df1[&#39;Time&#39;] = df1[&#39;Time&#39;].apply(lambda x : datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(x)) df1.head() .

He is 16 months now and I still use them. Not all the time, but often. The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain. He won&#39;t eat much when he&#39;s in pain, but these are easy on his gums. They are organic and a quick meal. My son is strong and a very healthy weight. I make sure he gets as much organic, wholesome food as possible. Buying these subscribe and save is a great way to give him good food and still save money.

I love my Keurig, and I don&#39;t mind buying the k-cups. What does bother me is the limited availability of flavored decaf coffees. I am a coffee addict and could drink it all day if it didn&#39;t keep me up all night. I have tried every other do it yourself k cup product out there and they all stink! This product actually works. It brews a decent cup of coffee, not watered down and not a single ground of coffee in the cup. This product is worth the money!

They are not only vegetarian and gluten-free, they have no preservatives. However, while authentic tasting, they are not quite spicy enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;After my young son decided to become a vegetarian, I started ordering this variety pack on a regular basis. Even though the price each is the same as it is in my local store, I can never find all six flavors at the same store at the same time, so it is worth it to order it this way. I serve these over basmati rice, and it&#39;s more than enough to feed two people. | first discovered several year ago trip san francisco rainbow market vegetarian gluten free preservative however authentic tasting quite spicy enough young son decided become vegetarian started ordering variety pack regular basis even though price local store never find six flavor store time worth order way serve basmati rice enough feed two people | . 40000 The description on the 16oz Carousel-Sugarfree Gumball Refill Ordered from Candy Crate Inc. reads it contains a qty. of 900 gumballs. This is a lie- when you recieve this product there are only 114 servings in a bag and the serving size is considered 2 gumballs- this is a total of only 228 gumballs. To get the quantity they are claiming you would actually have to purchase about 4 bags. The gumballs themselves are fine, but beware of the fake description. Hard to write a good review when I feel a little ripped off.

Although This is the best gluten free sour dough bread I have sampled thus far it is much too expensive to pay upwards to $30 for 3 loaves. I have shipped baked goods to military family priority mail for a flat rate of under ten bucks in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Company states they will reduce shipping charges in the future but that doesn&#39;t help me or others currently eager for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality/consistency of this bread, It is fluffy compared to ther bakeries and has not molded after 10 days. It toasts well and easily makes grilled sandwiches delicious. The nutritional content is as follows : 1 slice is 140 calories, no saturated or trans fats, total fat 2 grams. Cholesterol 20 mg, sodium 190 mg, total carb ( for one huge slice ) is 29 grams, fiber 1 gram , sugars 1 gram , protein 2 grams. This has definetly a great sour dough flavor and is not gritty like other gluten free baked goods from other bakeries..I only wish the shipping costs were less with this and all other gluten free baked goods. | updated mixed review due currently outrageous high shipping justify product value although best gluten free sour dough bread sampled thus far much expensive pay upwards loaf shipped baked good military family priority mail flat rate ten buck past company state reduce shipping charge future help others currently eager product quality consistency bread fluffy compared ther bakery molded day toast well easily make grilled sandwich delicious nutritional content follows slice calorie saturated trans fat total fat gram cholesterol mg sodium mg total carb one huge slice gram fiber gram sugar gram protein gram definetly great sour dough flavor gritty like gluten free baked good bakery wish shipping cost le gluten free baked good | . 70000 I don&#39;t have a gluten intolerance - just trying to cut back on the intake of wheat/gluten...and sugar, but that&#39;s another story;) so my body feels less bloated, unhealthy and lethargic due to wheat. With that said, I do know the differences in taste between wheat pastas, rice, quinoa, corn...etc. Personally, I have come to love the taste of non-wheat pastas over wheat, with the exception of corn flour, which isn&#39;t similar enough to wheat to fool my taste buds. Annie&#39;s does a fantastic job with this rice flour product, giving it a consistency and flavor akin to Kraft mac and cheese. What makes this better is the cheese, which tastes far yummier than any boxed mac &amp; cheese I have ever had. Also, it&#39;s real cheese, with as few bizarre ingredients as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like to see ingredients, here is a comparison (and please note I am not a nutritionist - just writing a friendly review:):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese:&lt;br /&gt;Cheese sauce mix ingredients: whey (milk protein), milk protein concentrate, milk, milkfat and cheese culture, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate and calcium phosphate, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid and enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar: cheddar cheese (cultured pasturized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), whey, buttermilk, salt, cream, natural flavor, natural sodium phosphate, annatto extract for natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*wiki annatto extract: Annatto coloring is produced from the reddish pericarp or pulp which surrounds the seed of the achiote (Bixa orellana L.). It is used in many natural cheeses (e.g., Cheddar, Red Leicester, Gouda (cheese) and Brie), margarine, butter, rice, smoked fish, and custard powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s also has less sodium and sugars, which I am grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Annie&#39;s does make another rice pasta mac and cheese - it&#39;s a deluxe box. This is what I would compare to Velveeta - for you lovers out there. It&#39;s the ooey gooey cheese that is thicker. Personally, I detest Velveeta, so the deluxe isn&#39;t as awesome as the simple Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar. But the deluxe IS better than macaroni with Velveeta because the consistency of the cheese isn&#39;t ridiculous overbearing and throat-clogging as Velveeta. I swear, I always felt like I would suffocate eating that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to those with allergies, and intolerance, or those like myself who are looking for ways to significantly reduce heat intake. My entire family has now switched from Kraft over to this product (and they didn&#39;t do it for health reasons - they simply prefer the taste!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a bit more pricey, I&#39;ll give you that. But for a hint - do check Target occasionally. They sell Annie&#39;s pastas and some amazing organic bunny fruit snacks - all of which go on sale quite often (I just purchased Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar for $1 a box!) If only the prices were always so kind;) | gluten intolerance trying cut back intake wheat gluten sugar another story body feel le bloated unhealthy lethargic due wheat said know difference taste wheat pasta rice quinoa corn etc personally come love taste non wheat pasta wheat exception corn flour similar enough wheat fool taste bud annie fantastic job rice flour product giving consistency flavor akin kraft mac cheese make better cheese taste far yummier boxed mac cheese ever also real cheese bizarre ingredient possible like see ingredient comparison please note nutritionist writing friendly review kraft mac cheese cheese sauce mix ingredient whey milk protein milk protein concentrate milk milkfat cheese culture salt sodium tripolyphosphate sodium phosphate calcium phosphate yellow yellow citric acid lactic acid enzyme annie rice pasta cheddar cheddar cheese cultured pasturized milk salt non animal enzyme whey buttermilk salt cream natural flavor natural sodium phosphate annatto extract natural color wiki annatto extract annatto coloring produced reddish pericarp pulp surround seed achiote bixa orellana l used many natural cheese e g cheddar red leicester gouda cheese brie margarine butter rice smoked fish custard powder annie also le sodium sugar grateful also annie make another rice pasta mac cheese deluxe box would compare velveeta lover ooey gooey cheese thicker personally detest velveeta deluxe awesome simple rice pasta cheddar deluxe better macaroni velveeta consistency cheese ridiculous overbearing throat clogging velveeta swear always felt like would suffocate eating stuff definitely recommend product allergy intolerance like looking way significantly reduce heat intake entire family switched kraft product health reason simply prefer taste bit pricey give hint check target occasionally sell annie pasta amazing organic bunny fruit snack go sale quite often purchased rice pasta cheddar box price always kind | . 80000 This drink tastes good. I enjoyed it. I also had my daughter and my grandchildren try it--they drank even more of it and found it pleasant to the taste. Once mixed and cold in the fridge, it didn&#39;t last long.

They are reminicent of a shortbread cookie with a hint of orange and some chewy Crasins thrown in for good measure. Fairly reasonable stats for a cookie (140 calories, 5 grams of total fat and 7 sugars)until you see that is only for THREE cookies. No way you&#39;re going to hold yourself to 3 lousy cookies in one sitting so you&#39;d better plan on doubling that. But it is still a better choice that a lot of offerings in the cookie isle. And that is just where I&#39;d go to purchase these. They didn&#39;t hold up well in shipping and I wound up with a lot of crumbs. Which I ate anyway. Because they were too yummy to let that stop me.

I don&#39;t like being sent a case of canned goods with the cans in the middle of the case crushed. What&#39;s up with that?&lt;br /&gt; I have been satisfied with the condition of other canned goods bought vie Amazon - but buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt; It is not worth my time to complain and return.&lt;br /&gt; But I won&#39;t buy Amy&#39;s soups through Amazon again, and in the future, will REALLY question whether buying ANY canned goods through Amazon is worth it - even if the price is right - considering that the goods may or may not arrive damaged.&lt;br /&gt; Hey Amazon, Honesty is the best policy.

When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent. The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine. When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug&#39;s worth of water, and made a cup. When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk. Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee. For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand. Some other things I love about this brand: it&#39;s organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That&#39;s a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup. The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs. This is a good deal. The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment. | several thing coffee lover look brew aroma color taste look opened individual pack hit wonderful coffee scent pod look typical made pod machine made first cup since aroma strong filled machine good sized mug worth water made cup done color fairly light added small amount milk still flavor bit bland like mild coffee second cup used smaller mug return got darker flavorful cup recommendation brand thing love brand organic sustainably grown fair trade certified lot benefit cent cup even foundation support youth soccer program good deal thing would change individual wrap seems like excess packaging company dedicated environment | .

A short note of what is Word Embedding . Word Embedding Word Embeddings are the texts converted into numbers and there may be different numerical representations of the same text In short, we can say that to build any model in machine learning or deep learning, the final level data has to be in numerical form because models don’t understand text or image data directly as humans do. Therefore, Vectorization or word embedding is the process of converting text data to numerical vectors. Later those vectors are used to build various machine learning models. In this manner, we say this as extracting features with the help of text with an aim to build multiple natural languages, processing models, etc. We have different ways to convert the text data to numerical vectors which we will discuss in this article later. Broadly, we can classified word embeddings into the following two categories: Frequency-based or Statistical based Word Embedding Prediction based Word Embedding . . filter0 = df1[&#39;Score&#39;] == 5 score_5 = df1[filter0] #filter only text_clen which score &lt;4 filter1 = df1[&#39;Score&#39;] &lt; 4 score_1to3 = df1[filter1] . score_5 = score_5[[&#39;Time&#39;,&#39;ProfileName&#39;,&#39;text_clean&#39;,&#39;Score&#39;]].iloc[0:500] #must be in the same shape . score_1to3 = score_1to3[[&#39;Time&#39;,&#39;ProfileName&#39;,&#39;text_clean&#39;,&#39;Score&#39;]].iloc[0:500] #must be in the same shape . tf_score5 = score_5 . score_5 .

He is 16 months now and I still use them. Not all the time, but often. The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain.

They are not only vegetarian and gluten-free, they have no preservatives. However, while authentic tasting, they are not quite spicy enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;After my young son decided to become a vegetarian, I started ordering this variety pack on a regular basis. Even though the price each is the same as it is in my local store, I can never find all six flavors at the same store at the same time, so it is worth it to order it this way. I serve these over basmati rice, and it&#39;s more than enough to feed two people. | first discovered several year ago trip san francisco rainbow market vegetarian gluten free preservative however authentic tasting quite spicy enough young son decided become vegetarian started ordering variety pack regular basis even though price local store never find six flavor store time worth order way serve basmati rice enough feed two people | . 40000 The description on the 16oz Carousel-Sugarfree Gumball Refill Ordered from Candy Crate Inc. reads it contains a qty. of 900 gumballs.

To get the quantity they are claiming you would actually have to purchase about 4 bags. The gumballs themselves are fine, but beware of the fake description.

Although This is the best gluten free sour dough bread I have sampled thus far it is much too expensive to pay upwards to $30 for 3 loaves. I have shipped baked goods to military family priority mail for a flat rate of under ten bucks in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Company states they will reduce shipping charges in the future but that doesn&#39;t help me or others currently eager for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality/consistency of this bread, It is fluffy compared to ther bakeries and has not molded after 10 days. It toasts well and easily makes grilled sandwiches delicious. The nutritional content is as follows : 1 slice is 140 calories, no saturated or trans fats, total fat 2 grams. Cholesterol 20 mg, sodium 190 mg, total carb ( for one huge slice ) is 29 grams, fiber 1 gram , sugars 1 gram , protein 2 grams. This has definetly a great sour dough flavor and is not gritty like other gluten free baked goods from other bakeries..I only wish the shipping costs were less with this and all other gluten free baked goods. | updated mixed review due currently outrageous high shipping justify product value although best gluten free sour dough bread sampled thus far much expensive pay upwards loaf shipped baked good military family priority mail flat rate ten buck past company state reduce shipping charge future help others currently eager product quality consistency bread fluffy compared ther bakery molded day toast well easily make grilled sandwich delicious nutritional content follows slice calorie saturated trans fat total fat gram cholesterol mg sodium mg total carb one huge slice gram fiber gram sugar gram protein gram definetly great sour dough flavor gritty like gluten free baked good bakery wish shipping cost le gluten free baked good | . 70000 I don&#39;t have a gluten intolerance - just trying to cut back on the intake of wheat/gluten...and sugar, but that&#39;s another story;) so my body feels less bloated, unhealthy and lethargic due to wheat. With that said, I do know the differences in taste between wheat pastas, rice, quinoa, corn...etc. Personally, I have come to love the taste of non-wheat pastas over wheat, with the exception of corn flour, which isn&#39;t similar enough to wheat to fool my taste buds. Annie&#39;s does a fantastic job with this rice flour product, giving it a consistency and flavor akin to Kraft mac and cheese. What makes this better is the cheese, which tastes far yummier than any boxed mac &amp; cheese I have ever had. Also, it&#39;s real cheese, with as few bizarre ingredients as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like to see ingredients, here is a comparison (and please note I am not a nutritionist - just writing a friendly review:):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese:&lt;br /&gt;Cheese sauce mix ingredients: whey (milk protein), milk protein concentrate, milk, milkfat and cheese culture, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate and calcium phosphate, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid and enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar: cheddar cheese (cultured pasturized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), whey, buttermilk, salt, cream, natural flavor, natural sodium phosphate, annatto extract for natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*wiki annatto extract: Annatto coloring is produced from the reddish pericarp or pulp which surrounds the seed of the achiote (Bixa orellana L.). It is used in many natural cheeses (e.g., Cheddar, Red Leicester, Gouda (cheese) and Brie), margarine, butter, rice, smoked fish, and custard powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s also has less sodium and sugars, which I am grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Annie&#39;s does make another rice pasta mac and cheese - it&#39;s a deluxe box. This is what I would compare to Velveeta - for you lovers out there. It&#39;s the ooey gooey cheese that is thicker. Personally, I detest Velveeta, so the deluxe isn&#39;t as awesome as the simple Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar. But the deluxe IS better than macaroni with Velveeta because the consistency of the cheese isn&#39;t ridiculous overbearing and throat-clogging as Velveeta. I swear, I always felt like I would suffocate eating that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to those with allergies, and intolerance, or those like myself who are looking for ways to significantly reduce heat intake. My entire family has now switched from Kraft over to this product (and they didn&#39;t do it for health reasons - they simply prefer the taste!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a bit more pricey, I&#39;ll give you that. But for a hint - do check Target occasionally. They sell Annie&#39;s pastas and some amazing organic bunny fruit snacks - all of which go on sale quite often (I just purchased Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar for $1 a box!) If only the prices were always so kind;) | gluten intolerance trying cut back intake wheat gluten sugar another story body feel le bloated unhealthy lethargic due wheat said know difference taste wheat pasta rice quinoa corn etc personally come love taste non wheat pasta wheat exception corn flour similar enough wheat fool taste bud annie fantastic job rice flour product giving consistency flavor akin kraft mac cheese make better cheese taste far yummier boxed mac cheese ever also real cheese bizarre ingredient possible like see ingredient comparison please note nutritionist writing friendly review kraft mac cheese cheese sauce mix ingredient whey milk protein milk protein concentrate milk milkfat cheese culture salt sodium tripolyphosphate sodium phosphate calcium phosphate yellow yellow citric acid lactic acid enzyme annie rice pasta cheddar cheddar cheese cultured pasturized milk salt non animal enzyme whey buttermilk salt cream natural flavor natural sodium phosphate annatto extract natural color wiki annatto extract annatto coloring produced reddish pericarp pulp surround seed achiote bixa orellana l used many natural cheese e g cheddar red leicester gouda cheese brie margarine butter rice smoked fish custard powder annie also le sodium sugar grateful also annie make another rice pasta mac cheese deluxe box would compare velveeta lover ooey gooey cheese thicker personally detest velveeta deluxe awesome simple rice pasta cheddar deluxe better macaroni velveeta consistency cheese ridiculous overbearing throat clogging velveeta swear always felt like would suffocate eating stuff definitely recommend product allergy intolerance like looking way significantly reduce heat intake entire family switched kraft product health reason simply prefer taste bit pricey give hint check target occasionally sell annie pasta amazing organic bunny fruit snack go sale quite often purchased rice pasta cheddar box price always kind | . 80000 This drink tastes good. I enjoyed it. I also had my daughter and my grandchildren try it--they drank even more of it and found it pleasant to the taste. Once mixed and cold in the fridge, it didn&#39;t last long.

They are reminicent of a shortbread cookie with a hint of orange and some chewy Crasins thrown in for good measure. Fairly reasonable stats for a cookie (140 calories, 5 grams of total fat and 7 sugars)until you see that is only for THREE cookies. No way you&#39;re going to hold yourself to 3 lousy cookies in one sitting so you&#39;d better plan on doubling that. But it is still a better choice that a lot of offerings in the cookie isle. And that is just where I&#39;d go to purchase these. They didn&#39;t hold up well in shipping and I wound up with a lot of crumbs. Which I ate anyway. Because they were too yummy to let that stop me.

I don&#39;t like being sent a case of canned goods with the cans in the middle of the case crushed. What&#39;s up with that?&lt;br /&gt; I have been satisfied with the condition of other canned goods bought vie Amazon - but buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt; It is not worth my time to complain and return.&lt;br /&gt; But I won&#39;t buy Amy&#39;s soups through Amazon again, and in the future, will REALLY question whether buying ANY canned goods through Amazon is worth it - even if the price is right - considering that the goods may or may not arrive damaged.&lt;br /&gt; Hey Amazon, Honesty is the best policy.

When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent. The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine. When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug&#39;s worth of water, and made a cup. When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk. Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee. For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand. Some other things I love about this brand: it&#39;s organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That&#39;s a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup. The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs. This is a good deal. The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment. | several thing coffee lover look brew aroma color taste look opened individual pack hit wonderful coffee scent pod look typical made pod machine made first cup since aroma strong filled machine good sized mug worth water made cup done color fairly light added small amount milk still flavor bit bland like mild coffee second cup used smaller mug return got darker flavorful cup recommendation brand thing love brand organic sustainably grown fair trade certified lot benefit cent cup even foundation support youth soccer program good deal thing would change individual wrap seems like excess packaging company dedicated environment | . . ax = df1[&#39;Satisfied&#39;].value_counts().plot(kind=&#39;bar&#39;, figsize=(8,8), title=&quot;Sentiment of Customer Extraced from Restaurant&#39;s reviews&quot;) ax.set_xlabel(&quot;Sentiment of Customer&quot;) ax.set_ylabel(&quot;Frequency&quot;) plt.show() .

I gave it to my wife to try before I would force myself to try it. She looked like a little kid that just tasted soda for the first time. This stuff is so good, tastes like you&#39;re drinking straight out of a coconut without spending an hour opening it. The pulp makes it that much better.

Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said &quot;Dark Chocolate&quot; so I ordered it. Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too. It showed up as &quot;Dark Hot&quot; when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate. Nope. Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work. Not the same thing at all even though it says &quot;Dark Chocolate&quot; (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12. I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store. But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside. | 1 | . 3 1281657600 | Jay Roberts &quot;Jay&quot; | Excellent Product | I originally purchased the smaller version of this product but upgraded to this version. It was 3/4 full of flies and I ended up throwing it away after maggots started appearing. It&#39;s pretty gross but very effective. I highly recommend purchasing more than one rather than re-using it. | 5 | . 4 1273104000 | Montana Rod &quot;Red Rooster&quot; | kids food | not as good as cheerio&#39;s but a lot cheaper. however, I will order cheerio&#39;s next time and buy these in bulk from the store. | 3 | . ... ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | . 113686 1317686400 | Richard Franco | Avoid this flavor | My daughter gobbles puffs up like they&#39;re manna from heaven... &quot;Puff&quot; is one of the first words she attempted to say... But this particular flavor she has totally rejected. She gets furious when I try to feed her this, as if I&#39;m trying to fool her by giving her something that resembles her beloved puffs but tastes like rubber. | 1 | . 113687 1294531200 | Mom of three | My family doesn&#39;t like it | This is only the second time I have purchased pure maple syrup. The first I bought at the grocery store; it was a grade A. It lacked much maple flavor. So I bought this grade B syrup, thinking the stronger flavor would be better liked. We hate it. It has a very bitter after taste. I don&#39;t know what to do now becuase we don&#39;t like the grade B, but the grade A isn&#39;t strong enough in flavor. | 2 | . 113688 1246492800 | Sara-s | Refreshing and not too sweet | This is a nice, refreshing carbonated drink. It has no added sugar, as advertised. But its name is a bit misleading. The &quot;Orange Tangerine&quot; also has some apple and grape juice added. The grape is not a great addition to the blend, so I wasn&#39;t thrilled with the flavor. | 4 | . 113689 1296345600 | Alex &quot;AG&quot; | Too much sediment | I do love Stash Honeybush but the tea bag version. I thought I&#39;ll give the lose tea a try. The tea leaves are cut TOO SMALL! The sediment is everywhere. I have to strain it 3 times. I&#39;m definitely not getting this again. | 1 | . 113690 1221091200 | Jennifer Jackson &quot;bargain hunter&quot; | Excellent! | When I first got this tea along with the diet raspberry flavor, I was hoping to find an instant tea that tasted a little bit better than other brand diet ones. This went above and beyond my expectations! I&#39;ve tried other diet teas and they seem to all have a distinct &quot;diet&quot; taste. These teas are great, very good flavor, no diet aftertaste! I can&#39;t decide if I like the raspberry or peach flavor better, both are very good. You can&#39;t even tell it&#39;s diet, you get that little pleasure of your tastebuds thinking they&#39;re getting the sugar, lol. | 5 | . 113691 rows × 5 columns . df1[&#39;Time&#39;] = df1[&#39;Time&#39;].apply(lambda x : datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(x)) df1.head() .

Method: 1) Using regular expresiion to get rid off any characters which are not alphabet and unnecssary 2) convert the string to lowercase 3) get rid off stopwords i.e &#39;the&#39;, &#39;an&#39;, &#39;to&#39;; these are considres as noise which could make a model less precise 4) lemmatization: chang different form of word i.e. working -&gt; work . #object of WordNetLemmatizer #processing time: around 40 min lm = WordNetLemmatizer() def text_transformation(df_col): corpus = [] for item in df_col: new_item = re.sub(&#39;[^a-zA-Z]&#39;,&#39; &#39;,str(item)) #match any characters which are not alphabet and replace with whitespace new_item = new_item.lower() # convert all to lower case new_item = new_item.split() # split each string by whitespace into a list # lemmarizing words &amp; select only words which are not stopword in English new_item = [lm.lemmatize(word) for word in new_item if word not in set(stopwords.words(&#39;english&#39;))] corpus.append(&#39; &#39;.join(str(x) for x in new_item)) return corpus corpus = text_transformation(df1[&#39;Text&#39;]) #Note: after cleaning text, there&#39;s some unwanted elements still #so it&#39;s required to used regular expression to get rid of them (&lt;br&gt;) pattern0 = r&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&#39; clean = [] for i in df1.text_clean: a = re.sub(pattern0, &#39; &#39;, i) clean.append(a) pattern1 = r&#39;&lt;br&gt;&#39; clean1= [] for i in clean: b = re.sub(pattern1, &#39; &#39;, i) clean1.append(b) pattern2 = r&#39; s(br) s&#39; clean2= [] for i in clean1: c = re.sub(pattern2, &#39; &#39;, i) clean2.append(c) . saveing the file df1.to_pickle(&quot;df1_clean.pkl&quot;) . print(stopwords.words(&#39;english&#39;)) .

He is 16 months now and I still use them. Not all the time, but often. The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain. He won&#39;t eat much when he&#39;s in pain, but these are easy on his gums. They are organic and a quick meal. My son is strong and a very healthy weight.

They are not only vegetarian and gluten-free, they have no preservatives. However, while authentic tasting, they are not quite spicy enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;After my young son decided to become a vegetarian, I started ordering this variety pack on a regular basis. Even though the price each is the same as it is in my local store, I can never find all six flavors at the same store at the same time, so it is worth it to order it this way. I serve these over basmati rice, and it&#39;s more than enough to feed two people. | first discovered several year ago trip san francisco rainbow market vegetarian gluten free preservative however authentic tasting quite spicy enough young son decided become vegetarian started ordering variety pack regular basis even though price local store never find six flavor store time worth order way serve basmati rice enough feed two people | . 40000 The description on the 16oz Carousel-Sugarfree Gumball Refill Ordered from Candy Crate Inc. reads it contains a qty. of 900 gumballs.

To get the quantity they are claiming you would actually have to purchase about 4 bags. The gumballs themselves are fine, but beware of the fake description.

Although This is the best gluten free sour dough bread I have sampled thus far it is much too expensive to pay upwards to $30 for 3 loaves. I have shipped baked goods to military family priority mail for a flat rate of under ten bucks in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Company states they will reduce shipping charges in the future but that doesn&#39;t help me or others currently eager for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality/consistency of this bread, It is fluffy compared to ther bakeries and has not molded after 10 days. It toasts well and easily makes grilled sandwiches delicious. The nutritional content is as follows : 1 slice is 140 calories, no saturated or trans fats, total fat 2 grams. Cholesterol 20 mg, sodium 190 mg, total carb ( for one huge slice ) is 29 grams, fiber 1 gram , sugars 1 gram , protein 2 grams. This has definetly a great sour dough flavor and is not gritty like other gluten free baked goods from other bakeries..I only wish the shipping costs were less with this and all other gluten free baked goods. | updated mixed review due currently outrageous high shipping justify product value although best gluten free sour dough bread sampled thus far much expensive pay upwards loaf shipped baked good military family priority mail flat rate ten buck past company state reduce shipping charge future help others currently eager product quality consistency bread fluffy compared ther bakery molded day toast well easily make grilled sandwich delicious nutritional content follows slice calorie saturated trans fat total fat gram cholesterol mg sodium mg total carb one huge slice gram fiber gram sugar gram protein gram definetly great sour dough flavor gritty like gluten free baked good bakery wish shipping cost le gluten free baked good | . 70000 I don&#39;t have a gluten intolerance - just trying to cut back on the intake of wheat/gluten...and sugar, but that&#39;s another story;) so my body feels less bloated, unhealthy and lethargic due to wheat. With that said, I do know the differences in taste between wheat pastas, rice, quinoa, corn...etc. Personally, I have come to love the taste of non-wheat pastas over wheat, with the exception of corn flour, which isn&#39;t similar enough to wheat to fool my taste buds. Annie&#39;s does a fantastic job with this rice flour product, giving it a consistency and flavor akin to Kraft mac and cheese. What makes this better is the cheese, which tastes far yummier than any boxed mac &amp; cheese I have ever had. Also, it&#39;s real cheese, with as few bizarre ingredients as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like to see ingredients, here is a comparison (and please note I am not a nutritionist - just writing a friendly review:):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese:&lt;br /&gt;Cheese sauce mix ingredients: whey (milk protein), milk protein concentrate, milk, milkfat and cheese culture, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate and calcium phosphate, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid and enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar: cheddar cheese (cultured pasturized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), whey, buttermilk, salt, cream, natural flavor, natural sodium phosphate, annatto extract for natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*wiki annatto extract: Annatto coloring is produced from the reddish pericarp or pulp which surrounds the seed of the achiote (Bixa orellana L.). It is used in many natural cheeses (e.g., Cheddar, Red Leicester, Gouda (cheese) and Brie), margarine, butter, rice, smoked fish, and custard powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s also has less sodium and sugars, which I am grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Annie&#39;s does make another rice pasta mac and cheese - it&#39;s a deluxe box. This is what I would compare to Velveeta - for you lovers out there. It&#39;s the ooey gooey cheese that is thicker. Personally, I detest Velveeta, so the deluxe isn&#39;t as awesome as the simple Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar. But the deluxe IS better than macaroni with Velveeta because the consistency of the cheese isn&#39;t ridiculous overbearing and throat-clogging as Velveeta. I swear, I always felt like I would suffocate eating that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to those with allergies, and intolerance, or those like myself who are looking for ways to significantly reduce heat intake. My entire family has now switched from Kraft over to this product (and they didn&#39;t do it for health reasons - they simply prefer the taste!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a bit more pricey, I&#39;ll give you that. But for a hint - do check Target occasionally. They sell Annie&#39;s pastas and some amazing organic bunny fruit snacks - all of which go on sale quite often (I just purchased Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar for $1 a box!)

They are reminicent of a shortbread cookie with a hint of orange and some chewy Crasins thrown in for good measure. Fairly reasonable stats for a cookie (140 calories, 5 grams of total fat and 7 sugars)until you see that is only for THREE cookies. No way you&#39;re going to hold yourself to 3 lousy cookies in one sitting so you&#39;d better plan on doubling that. But it is still a better choice that a lot of offerings in the cookie isle. And that is just where I&#39;d go to purchase these. They didn&#39;t hold up well in shipping and I wound up with a lot of crumbs. Which I ate anyway. Because they were too yummy to let that stop me.

I don&#39;t like being sent a case of canned goods with the cans in the middle of the case crushed. What&#39;s up with that?&lt;br /&gt; I have been satisfied with the condition of other canned goods bought vie Amazon - but buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt; It is not worth my time to complain and return.&lt;br /&gt; But I won&#39;t buy Amy&#39;s soups through Amazon again, and in the future, will REALLY question whether buying ANY canned goods through Amazon is worth it - even if the price is right - considering that the goods may or may not arrive damaged.&lt;br /&gt; Hey Amazon, Honesty is the best policy.

When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent. The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine. When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug&#39;s worth of water, and made a cup. When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk. Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee. For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand. Some other things I love about this brand: it&#39;s organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That&#39;s a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup. The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs. This is a good deal. The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment. | several thing coffee lover look brew aroma color taste look opened individual pack hit wonderful coffee scent pod look typical made pod machine made first cup since aroma strong filled machine good sized mug worth water made cup done color fairly light added small amount milk still flavor bit bland like mild coffee second cup used smaller mug return got darker flavorful cup recommendation brand thing love brand organic sustainably grown fair trade certified lot benefit cent cup even foundation support youth soccer program good deal thing would change individual wrap seems like excess packaging company dedicated environment | .

A short note of what is Word Embedding . Word Embedding Word Embeddings are the texts converted into numbers and there may be different numerical representations of the same text In short, we can say that to build any model in machine learning or deep learning, the final level data has to be in numerical form because models don’t understand text or image data directly as humans do. Therefore, Vectorization or word embedding is the process of converting text data to numerical vectors. Later those vectors are used to build various machine learning models. In this manner, we say this as extracting features with the help of text with an aim to build multiple natural languages, processing models, etc. We have different ways to convert the text data to numerical vectors which we will discuss in this article later. Broadly, we can classified word embeddings into the following two categories: Frequency-based or Statistical based Word Embedding Prediction based Word Embedding . . filter0 = df1[&#39;Score&#39;] == 5 score_5 = df1[filter0] #filter only text_clen which score &lt;4 filter1 = df1[&#39;Score&#39;] &lt; 4 score_1to3 = df1[filter1] . score_5 = score_5[[&#39;Time&#39;,&#39;ProfileName&#39;,&#39;text_clean&#39;,&#39;Score&#39;]].iloc[0:500] #must be in the same shape . score_1to3 = score_1to3[[&#39;Time&#39;,&#39;ProfileName&#39;,&#39;text_clean&#39;,&#39;Score&#39;]].iloc[0:500] #must be in the same shape . tf_score5 = score_5 . score_5 .

He is 16 months now and I still use them. Not all the time, but often. The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain.

They are not only vegetarian and gluten-free, they have no preservatives. However, while authentic tasting, they are not quite spicy enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;After my young son decided to become a vegetarian, I started ordering this variety pack on a regular basis. Even though the price each is the same as it is in my local store, I can never find all six flavors at the same store at the same time, so it is worth it to order it this way. I serve these over basmati rice, and it&#39;s more than enough to feed two people. | first discovered several year ago trip san francisco rainbow market vegetarian gluten free preservative however authentic tasting quite spicy enough young son decided become vegetarian started ordering variety pack regular basis even though price local store never find six flavor store time worth order way serve basmati rice enough feed two people | . 40000 The description on the 16oz Carousel-Sugarfree Gumball Refill Ordered from Candy Crate Inc. reads it contains a qty. of 900 gumballs. This is a lie- when you recieve this product there are only 114 servings in a bag and the serving size is considered 2 gumballs- this is a total of only 228 gumballs. To get the quantity they are claiming you would actually have to purchase about 4 bags. The gumballs themselves are fine, but beware of the fake description. Hard to write a good review when I feel a little ripped off.

Although This is the best gluten free sour dough bread I have sampled thus far it is much too expensive to pay upwards to $30 for 3 loaves. I have shipped baked goods to military family priority mail for a flat rate of under ten bucks in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Company states they will reduce shipping charges in the future but that doesn&#39;t help me or others currently eager for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality/consistency of this bread, It is fluffy compared to ther bakeries and has not molded after 10 days. It toasts well and easily makes grilled sandwiches delicious. The nutritional content is as follows : 1 slice is 140 calories, no saturated or trans fats, total fat 2 grams. Cholesterol 20 mg, sodium 190 mg, total carb ( for one huge slice ) is 29 grams, fiber 1 gram , sugars 1 gram , protein 2 grams. This has definetly a great sour dough flavor and is not gritty like other gluten free baked goods from other bakeries..I only wish the shipping costs were less with this and all other gluten free baked goods. | updated mixed review due currently outrageous high shipping justify product value although best gluten free sour dough bread sampled thus far much expensive pay upwards loaf shipped baked good military family priority mail flat rate ten buck past company state reduce shipping charge future help others currently eager product quality consistency bread fluffy compared ther bakery molded day toast well easily make grilled sandwich delicious nutritional content follows slice calorie saturated trans fat total fat gram cholesterol mg sodium mg total carb one huge slice gram fiber gram sugar gram protein gram definetly great sour dough flavor gritty like gluten free baked good bakery wish shipping cost le gluten free baked good | . 70000 I don&#39;t have a gluten intolerance - just trying to cut back on the intake of wheat/gluten...and sugar, but that&#39;s another story;) so my body feels less bloated, unhealthy and lethargic due to wheat. With that said, I do know the differences in taste between wheat pastas, rice, quinoa, corn...etc. Personally, I have come to love the taste of non-wheat pastas over wheat, with the exception of corn flour, which isn&#39;t similar enough to wheat to fool my taste buds. Annie&#39;s does a fantastic job with this rice flour product, giving it a consistency and flavor akin to Kraft mac and cheese. What makes this better is the cheese, which tastes far yummier than any boxed mac &amp; cheese I have ever had. Also, it&#39;s real cheese, with as few bizarre ingredients as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like to see ingredients, here is a comparison (and please note I am not a nutritionist - just writing a friendly review:):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese:&lt;br /&gt;Cheese sauce mix ingredients: whey (milk protein), milk protein concentrate, milk, milkfat and cheese culture, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate and calcium phosphate, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid and enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar: cheddar cheese (cultured pasturized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), whey, buttermilk, salt, cream, natural flavor, natural sodium phosphate, annatto extract for natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*wiki annatto extract: Annatto coloring is produced from the reddish pericarp or pulp which surrounds the seed of the achiote (Bixa orellana L.). It is used in many natural cheeses (e.g., Cheddar, Red Leicester, Gouda (cheese) and Brie), margarine, butter, rice, smoked fish, and custard powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s also has less sodium and sugars, which I am grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Annie&#39;s does make another rice pasta mac and cheese - it&#39;s a deluxe box. This is what I would compare to Velveeta - for you lovers out there. It&#39;s the ooey gooey cheese that is thicker. Personally, I detest Velveeta, so the deluxe isn&#39;t as awesome as the simple Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar. But the deluxe IS better than macaroni with Velveeta because the consistency of the cheese isn&#39;t ridiculous overbearing and throat-clogging as Velveeta. I swear, I always felt like I would suffocate eating that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to those with allergies, and intolerance, or those like myself who are looking for ways to significantly reduce heat intake. My entire family has now switched from Kraft over to this product (and they didn&#39;t do it for health reasons - they simply prefer the taste!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a bit more pricey, I&#39;ll give you that. But for a hint - do check Target occasionally. They sell Annie&#39;s pastas and some amazing organic bunny fruit snacks - all of which go on sale quite often (I just purchased Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar for $1 a box!) If only the prices were always so kind;) | gluten intolerance trying cut back intake wheat gluten sugar another story body feel le bloated unhealthy lethargic due wheat said know difference taste wheat pasta rice quinoa corn etc personally come love taste non wheat pasta wheat exception corn flour similar enough wheat fool taste bud annie fantastic job rice flour product giving consistency flavor akin kraft mac cheese make better cheese taste far yummier boxed mac cheese ever also real cheese bizarre ingredient possible like see ingredient comparison please note nutritionist writing friendly review kraft mac cheese cheese sauce mix ingredient whey milk protein milk protein concentrate milk milkfat cheese culture salt sodium tripolyphosphate sodium phosphate calcium phosphate yellow yellow citric acid lactic acid enzyme annie rice pasta cheddar cheddar cheese cultured pasturized milk salt non animal enzyme whey buttermilk salt cream natural flavor natural sodium phosphate annatto extract natural color wiki annatto extract annatto coloring produced reddish pericarp pulp surround seed achiote bixa orellana l used many natural cheese e g cheddar red leicester gouda cheese brie margarine butter rice smoked fish custard powder annie also le sodium sugar grateful also annie make another rice pasta mac cheese deluxe box would compare velveeta lover ooey gooey cheese thicker personally detest velveeta deluxe awesome simple rice pasta cheddar deluxe better macaroni velveeta consistency cheese ridiculous overbearing throat clogging velveeta swear always felt like would suffocate eating stuff definitely recommend product allergy intolerance like looking way significantly reduce heat intake entire family switched kraft product health reason simply prefer taste bit pricey give hint check target occasionally sell annie pasta amazing organic bunny fruit snack go sale quite often purchased rice pasta cheddar box price always kind | . 80000 This drink tastes good. I enjoyed it. I also had my daughter and my grandchildren try it--they drank even more of it and found it pleasant to the taste. Once mixed and cold in the fridge, it didn&#39;t last long.

They are reminicent of a shortbread cookie with a hint of orange and some chewy Crasins thrown in for good measure. Fairly reasonable stats for a cookie (140 calories, 5 grams of total fat and 7 sugars)until you see that is only for THREE cookies. No way you&#39;re going to hold yourself to 3 lousy cookies in one sitting so you&#39;d better plan on doubling that. But it is still a better choice that a lot of offerings in the cookie isle. And that is just where I&#39;d go to purchase these. They didn&#39;t hold up well in shipping and I wound up with a lot of crumbs. Which I ate anyway. Because they were too yummy to let that stop me.

I don&#39;t like being sent a case of canned goods with the cans in the middle of the case crushed. What&#39;s up with that?&lt;br /&gt; I have been satisfied with the condition of other canned goods bought vie Amazon - but buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt; It is not worth my time to complain and return.&lt;br /&gt; But I won&#39;t buy Amy&#39;s soups through Amazon again, and in the future, will REALLY question whether buying ANY canned goods through Amazon is worth it - even if the price is right - considering that the goods may or may not arrive damaged.&lt;br /&gt; Hey Amazon, Honesty is the best policy.

When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent. The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine. When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug&#39;s worth of water, and made a cup. When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk. Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee. For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand. Some other things I love about this brand: it&#39;s organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That&#39;s a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup. The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs. This is a good deal. The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment. | several thing coffee lover look brew aroma color taste look opened individual pack hit wonderful coffee scent pod look typical made pod machine made first cup since aroma strong filled machine good sized mug worth water made cup done color fairly light added small amount milk still flavor bit bland like mild coffee second cup used smaller mug return got darker flavorful cup recommendation brand thing love brand organic sustainably grown fair trade certified lot benefit cent cup even foundation support youth soccer program good deal thing would change individual wrap seems like excess packaging company dedicated environment | . .

I gave it to my wife to try before I would force myself to try it. She looked like a little kid that just tasted soda for the first time. This stuff is so good, tastes like you&#39;re drinking straight out of a coconut without spending an hour opening it. The pulp makes it that much better. I could see this taking the place of a soda drinker pretty easily. SO GOOD. | 5 | . 1 1343520000 | K. Nealon &quot;K.

Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said &quot;Dark Chocolate&quot; so I ordered it. Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too. It showed up as &quot;Dark Hot&quot; when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate. Nope. Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work. Not the same thing at all even though it says &quot;Dark Chocolate&quot; (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12. I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store. But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside. | 1 | . 3 1281657600 | Jay Roberts &quot;Jay&quot; | Excellent Product | I originally purchased the smaller version of this product but upgraded to this version. It was 3/4 full of flies and I ended up throwing it away after maggots started appearing. It&#39;s pretty gross but very effective. I highly recommend purchasing more than one rather than re-using it. | 5 | . 4 1273104000 | Montana Rod &quot;Red Rooster&quot; | kids food | not as good as cheerio&#39;s but a lot cheaper. however, I will order cheerio&#39;s next time and buy these in bulk from the store. | 3 | . ... ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | . 113686 1317686400 | Richard Franco | Avoid this flavor | My daughter gobbles puffs up like they&#39;re manna from heaven... &quot;Puff&quot; is one of the first words she attempted to say... But this particular flavor she has totally rejected. She gets furious when I try to feed her this, as if I&#39;m trying to fool her by giving her something that resembles her beloved puffs but tastes like rubber. | 1 | . 113687 1294531200 | Mom of three | My family doesn&#39;t like it | This is only the second time I have purchased pure maple syrup. The first I bought at the grocery store; it was a grade A. It lacked much maple flavor. So I bought this grade B syrup, thinking the stronger flavor would be better liked. We hate it. It has a very bitter after taste. I don&#39;t know what to do now becuase we don&#39;t like the grade B, but the grade A isn&#39;t strong enough in flavor. | 2 | . 113688 1246492800 | Sara-s | Refreshing and not too sweet | This is a nice, refreshing carbonated drink. It has no added sugar, as advertised. But its name is a bit misleading. The &quot;Orange Tangerine&quot; also has some apple and grape juice added. The grape is not a great addition to the blend, so I wasn&#39;t thrilled with the flavor. | 4 | . 113689 1296345600 | Alex &quot;AG&quot; | Too much sediment | I do love Stash Honeybush but the tea bag version. I thought I&#39;ll give the lose tea a try. The tea leaves are cut TOO SMALL! The sediment is everywhere. I have to strain it 3 times. I&#39;m definitely not getting this again. | 1 | . 113690 1221091200 | Jennifer Jackson &quot;bargain hunter&quot; | Excellent! | When I first got this tea along with the diet raspberry flavor, I was hoping to find an instant tea that tasted a little bit better than other brand diet ones. This went above and beyond my expectations! I&#39;ve tried other diet teas and they seem to all have a distinct &quot;diet&quot; taste. These teas are great, very good flavor, no diet aftertaste! I can&#39;t decide if I like the raspberry or peach flavor better, both are very good. You can&#39;t even tell it&#39;s diet, you get that little pleasure of your tastebuds thinking they&#39;re getting the sugar, lol. | 5 | . 113691 rows × 5 columns . df1[&#39;Time&#39;] = df1[&#39;Time&#39;].apply(lambda x : datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(x)) df1.head() .

He is 16 months now and I still use them. Not all the time, but often. The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain. He won&#39;t eat much when he&#39;s in pain, but these are easy on his gums. They are organic and a quick meal. My son is strong and a very healthy weight. I make sure he gets as much organic, wholesome food as possible. Buying these subscribe and save is a great way to give him good food and still save money.

I love my Keurig, and I don&#39;t mind buying the k-cups. What does bother me is the limited availability of flavored decaf coffees. I am a coffee addict and could drink it all day if it didn&#39;t keep me up all night. I have tried every other do it yourself k cup product out there and they all stink! This product actually works. It brews a decent cup of coffee, not watered down and not a single ground of coffee in the cup. This product is worth the money!

They are not only vegetarian and gluten-free, they have no preservatives. However, while authentic tasting, they are not quite spicy enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;After my young son decided to become a vegetarian, I started ordering this variety pack on a regular basis. Even though the price each is the same as it is in my local store, I can never find all six flavors at the same store at the same time, so it is worth it to order it this way. I serve these over basmati rice, and it&#39;s more than enough to feed two people. | first discovered several year ago trip san francisco rainbow market vegetarian gluten free preservative however authentic tasting quite spicy enough young son decided become vegetarian started ordering variety pack regular basis even though price local store never find six flavor store time worth order way serve basmati rice enough feed two people | . 40000 The description on the 16oz Carousel-Sugarfree Gumball Refill Ordered from Candy Crate Inc. reads it contains a qty. of 900 gumballs. This is a lie- when you recieve this product there are only 114 servings in a bag and the serving size is considered 2 gumballs- this is a total of only 228 gumballs. To get the quantity they are claiming you would actually have to purchase about 4 bags. The gumballs themselves are fine, but beware of the fake description. Hard to write a good review when I feel a little ripped off.

Although This is the best gluten free sour dough bread I have sampled thus far it is much too expensive to pay upwards to $30 for 3 loaves. I have shipped baked goods to military family priority mail for a flat rate of under ten bucks in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Company states they will reduce shipping charges in the future but that doesn&#39;t help me or others currently eager for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality/consistency of this bread, It is fluffy compared to ther bakeries and has not molded after 10 days. It toasts well and easily makes grilled sandwiches delicious. The nutritional content is as follows : 1 slice is 140 calories, no saturated or trans fats, total fat 2 grams. Cholesterol 20 mg, sodium 190 mg, total carb ( for one huge slice ) is 29 grams, fiber 1 gram , sugars 1 gram , protein 2 grams. This has definetly a great sour dough flavor and is not gritty like other gluten free baked goods from other bakeries..I only wish the shipping costs were less with this and all other gluten free baked goods. | updated mixed review due currently outrageous high shipping justify product value although best gluten free sour dough bread sampled thus far much expensive pay upwards loaf shipped baked good military family priority mail flat rate ten buck past company state reduce shipping charge future help others currently eager product quality consistency bread fluffy compared ther bakery molded day toast well easily make grilled sandwich delicious nutritional content follows slice calorie saturated trans fat total fat gram cholesterol mg sodium mg total carb one huge slice gram fiber gram sugar gram protein gram definetly great sour dough flavor gritty like gluten free baked good bakery wish shipping cost le gluten free baked good | . 70000 I don&#39;t have a gluten intolerance - just trying to cut back on the intake of wheat/gluten...and sugar, but that&#39;s another story;) so my body feels less bloated, unhealthy and lethargic due to wheat. With that said, I do know the differences in taste between wheat pastas, rice, quinoa, corn...etc. Personally, I have come to love the taste of non-wheat pastas over wheat, with the exception of corn flour, which isn&#39;t similar enough to wheat to fool my taste buds. Annie&#39;s does a fantastic job with this rice flour product, giving it a consistency and flavor akin to Kraft mac and cheese. What makes this better is the cheese, which tastes far yummier than any boxed mac &amp; cheese I have ever had. Also, it&#39;s real cheese, with as few bizarre ingredients as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like to see ingredients, here is a comparison (and please note I am not a nutritionist - just writing a friendly review:):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese:&lt;br /&gt;Cheese sauce mix ingredients: whey (milk protein), milk protein concentrate, milk, milkfat and cheese culture, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate and calcium phosphate, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid and enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar: cheddar cheese (cultured pasturized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), whey, buttermilk, salt, cream, natural flavor, natural sodium phosphate, annatto extract for natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*wiki annatto extract: Annatto coloring is produced from the reddish pericarp or pulp which surrounds the seed of the achiote (Bixa orellana L.). It is used in many natural cheeses (e.g., Cheddar, Red Leicester, Gouda (cheese) and Brie), margarine, butter, rice, smoked fish, and custard powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s also has less sodium and sugars, which I am grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Annie&#39;s does make another rice pasta mac and cheese - it&#39;s a deluxe box. This is what I would compare to Velveeta - for you lovers out there. It&#39;s the ooey gooey cheese that is thicker. Personally, I detest Velveeta, so the deluxe isn&#39;t as awesome as the simple Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar. But the deluxe IS better than macaroni with Velveeta because the consistency of the cheese isn&#39;t ridiculous overbearing and throat-clogging as Velveeta. I swear, I always felt like I would suffocate eating that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to those with allergies, and intolerance, or those like myself who are looking for ways to significantly reduce heat intake. My entire family has now switched from Kraft over to this product (and they didn&#39;t do it for health reasons - they simply prefer the taste!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a bit more pricey, I&#39;ll give you that. But for a hint - do check Target occasionally. They sell Annie&#39;s pastas and some amazing organic bunny fruit snacks - all of which go on sale quite often (I just purchased Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar for $1 a box!) If only the prices were always so kind;) | gluten intolerance trying cut back intake wheat gluten sugar another story body feel le bloated unhealthy lethargic due wheat said know difference taste wheat pasta rice quinoa corn etc personally come love taste non wheat pasta wheat exception corn flour similar enough wheat fool taste bud annie fantastic job rice flour product giving consistency flavor akin kraft mac cheese make better cheese taste far yummier boxed mac cheese ever also real cheese bizarre ingredient possible like see ingredient comparison please note nutritionist writing friendly review kraft mac cheese cheese sauce mix ingredient whey milk protein milk protein concentrate milk milkfat cheese culture salt sodium tripolyphosphate sodium phosphate calcium phosphate yellow yellow citric acid lactic acid enzyme annie rice pasta cheddar cheddar cheese cultured pasturized milk salt non animal enzyme whey buttermilk salt cream natural flavor natural sodium phosphate annatto extract natural color wiki annatto extract annatto coloring produced reddish pericarp pulp surround seed achiote bixa orellana l used many natural cheese e g cheddar red leicester gouda cheese brie margarine butter rice smoked fish custard powder annie also le sodium sugar grateful also annie make another rice pasta mac cheese deluxe box would compare velveeta lover ooey gooey cheese thicker personally detest velveeta deluxe awesome simple rice pasta cheddar deluxe better macaroni velveeta consistency cheese ridiculous overbearing throat clogging velveeta swear always felt like would suffocate eating stuff definitely recommend product allergy intolerance like looking way significantly reduce heat intake entire family switched kraft product health reason simply prefer taste bit pricey give hint check target occasionally sell annie pasta amazing organic bunny fruit snack go sale quite often purchased rice pasta cheddar box price always kind | . 80000 This drink tastes good. I enjoyed it. I also had my daughter and my grandchildren try it--they drank even more of it and found it pleasant to the taste. Once mixed and cold in the fridge, it didn&#39;t last long.

They are reminicent of a shortbread cookie with a hint of orange and some chewy Crasins thrown in for good measure. Fairly reasonable stats for a cookie (140 calories, 5 grams of total fat and 7 sugars)until you see that is only for THREE cookies. No way you&#39;re going to hold yourself to 3 lousy cookies in one sitting so you&#39;d better plan on doubling that. But it is still a better choice that a lot of offerings in the cookie isle. And that is just where I&#39;d go to purchase these. They didn&#39;t hold up well in shipping and I wound up with a lot of crumbs. Which I ate anyway. Because they were too yummy to let that stop me.

I don&#39;t like being sent a case of canned goods with the cans in the middle of the case crushed. What&#39;s up with that?&lt;br /&gt; I have been satisfied with the condition of other canned goods bought vie Amazon - but buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt; It is not worth my time to complain and return.&lt;br /&gt; But I won&#39;t buy Amy&#39;s soups through Amazon again, and in the future, will REALLY question whether buying ANY canned goods through Amazon is worth it - even if the price is right - considering that the goods may or may not arrive damaged.&lt;br /&gt; Hey Amazon, Honesty is the best policy.

When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent. The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine. When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug&#39;s worth of water, and made a cup. When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk. Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee. For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand. Some other things I love about this brand: it&#39;s organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That&#39;s a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup. The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs. This is a good deal. The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment. | several thing coffee lover look brew aroma color taste look opened individual pack hit wonderful coffee scent pod look typical made pod machine made first cup since aroma strong filled machine good sized mug worth water made cup done color fairly light added small amount milk still flavor bit bland like mild coffee second cup used smaller mug return got darker flavorful cup recommendation brand thing love brand organic sustainably grown fair trade certified lot benefit cent cup even foundation support youth soccer program good deal thing would change individual wrap seems like excess packaging company dedicated environment | .

A short note of what is Word Embedding . Word Embedding Word Embeddings are the texts converted into numbers and there may be different numerical representations of the same text In short, we can say that to build any model in machine learning or deep learning, the final level data has to be in numerical form because models don’t understand text or image data directly as humans do. Therefore, Vectorization or word embedding is the process of converting text data to numerical vectors. Later those vectors are used to build various machine learning models. In this manner, we say this as extracting features with the help of text with an aim to build multiple natural languages, processing models, etc. We have different ways to convert the text data to numerical vectors which we will discuss in this article later. Broadly, we can classified word embeddings into the following two categories: Frequency-based or Statistical based Word Embedding Prediction based Word Embedding . . filter0 = df1[&#39;Score&#39;] == 5 score_5 = df1[filter0] #filter only text_clen which score &lt;4 filter1 = df1[&#39;Score&#39;] &lt; 4 score_1to3 = df1[filter1] . score_5 = score_5[[&#39;Time&#39;,&#39;ProfileName&#39;,&#39;text_clean&#39;,&#39;Score&#39;]].iloc[0:500] #must be in the same shape . score_1to3 = score_1to3[[&#39;Time&#39;,&#39;ProfileName&#39;,&#39;text_clean&#39;,&#39;Score&#39;]].iloc[0:500] #must be in the same shape . tf_score5 = score_5 . score_5 .

He is 16 months now and I still use them. Not all the time, but often. The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain.

They are not only vegetarian and gluten-free, they have no preservatives. However, while authentic tasting, they are not quite spicy enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;After my young son decided to become a vegetarian, I started ordering this variety pack on a regular basis. Even though the price each is the same as it is in my local store, I can never find all six flavors at the same store at the same time, so it is worth it to order it this way. I serve these over basmati rice, and it&#39;s more than enough to feed two people. | first discovered several year ago trip san francisco rainbow market vegetarian gluten free preservative however authentic tasting quite spicy enough young son decided become vegetarian started ordering variety pack regular basis even though price local store never find six flavor store time worth order way serve basmati rice enough feed two people | . 40000 The description on the 16oz Carousel-Sugarfree Gumball Refill Ordered from Candy Crate Inc. reads it contains a qty. of 900 gumballs. This is a lie- when you recieve this product there are only 114 servings in a bag and the serving size is considered 2 gumballs- this is a total of only 228 gumballs. To get the quantity they are claiming you would actually have to purchase about 4 bags. The gumballs themselves are fine, but beware of the fake description. Hard to write a good review when I feel a little ripped off.

Although This is the best gluten free sour dough bread I have sampled thus far it is much too expensive to pay upwards to $30 for 3 loaves. I have shipped baked goods to military family priority mail for a flat rate of under ten bucks in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Company states they will reduce shipping charges in the future but that doesn&#39;t help me or others currently eager for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality/consistency of this bread, It is fluffy compared to ther bakeries and has not molded after 10 days. It toasts well and easily makes grilled sandwiches delicious. The nutritional content is as follows : 1 slice is 140 calories, no saturated or trans fats, total fat 2 grams. Cholesterol 20 mg, sodium 190 mg, total carb ( for one huge slice ) is 29 grams, fiber 1 gram , sugars 1 gram , protein 2 grams. This has definetly a great sour dough flavor and is not gritty like other gluten free baked goods from other bakeries..I only wish the shipping costs were less with this and all other gluten free baked goods. | updated mixed review due currently outrageous high shipping justify product value although best gluten free sour dough bread sampled thus far much expensive pay upwards loaf shipped baked good military family priority mail flat rate ten buck past company state reduce shipping charge future help others currently eager product quality consistency bread fluffy compared ther bakery molded day toast well easily make grilled sandwich delicious nutritional content follows slice calorie saturated trans fat total fat gram cholesterol mg sodium mg total carb one huge slice gram fiber gram sugar gram protein gram definetly great sour dough flavor gritty like gluten free baked good bakery wish shipping cost le gluten free baked good | . 70000 I don&#39;t have a gluten intolerance - just trying to cut back on the intake of wheat/gluten...and sugar, but that&#39;s another story;) so my body feels less bloated, unhealthy and lethargic due to wheat. With that said, I do know the differences in taste between wheat pastas, rice, quinoa, corn...etc. Personally, I have come to love the taste of non-wheat pastas over wheat, with the exception of corn flour, which isn&#39;t similar enough to wheat to fool my taste buds. Annie&#39;s does a fantastic job with this rice flour product, giving it a consistency and flavor akin to Kraft mac and cheese. What makes this better is the cheese, which tastes far yummier than any boxed mac &amp; cheese I have ever had. Also, it&#39;s real cheese, with as few bizarre ingredients as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like to see ingredients, here is a comparison (and please note I am not a nutritionist - just writing a friendly review:):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese:&lt;br /&gt;Cheese sauce mix ingredients: whey (milk protein), milk protein concentrate, milk, milkfat and cheese culture, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate and calcium phosphate, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid and enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar: cheddar cheese (cultured pasturized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), whey, buttermilk, salt, cream, natural flavor, natural sodium phosphate, annatto extract for natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*wiki annatto extract: Annatto coloring is produced from the reddish pericarp or pulp which surrounds the seed of the achiote (Bixa orellana L.). It is used in many natural cheeses (e.g., Cheddar, Red Leicester, Gouda (cheese) and Brie), margarine, butter, rice, smoked fish, and custard powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s also has less sodium and sugars, which I am grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Annie&#39;s does make another rice pasta mac and cheese - it&#39;s a deluxe box. This is what I would compare to Velveeta - for you lovers out there. It&#39;s the ooey gooey cheese that is thicker. Personally, I detest Velveeta, so the deluxe isn&#39;t as awesome as the simple Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar. But the deluxe IS better than macaroni with Velveeta because the consistency of the cheese isn&#39;t ridiculous overbearing and throat-clogging as Velveeta. I swear, I always felt like I would suffocate eating that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to those with allergies, and intolerance, or those like myself who are looking for ways to significantly reduce heat intake. My entire family has now switched from Kraft over to this product (and they didn&#39;t do it for health reasons - they simply prefer the taste!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a bit more pricey, I&#39;ll give you that. But for a hint - do check Target occasionally. They sell Annie&#39;s pastas and some amazing organic bunny fruit snacks - all of which go on sale quite often (I just purchased Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar for $1 a box!) If only the prices were always so kind;) | gluten intolerance trying cut back intake wheat gluten sugar another story body feel le bloated unhealthy lethargic due wheat said know difference taste wheat pasta rice quinoa corn etc personally come love taste non wheat pasta wheat exception corn flour similar enough wheat fool taste bud annie fantastic job rice flour product giving consistency flavor akin kraft mac cheese make better cheese taste far yummier boxed mac cheese ever also real cheese bizarre ingredient possible like see ingredient comparison please note nutritionist writing friendly review kraft mac cheese cheese sauce mix ingredient whey milk protein milk protein concentrate milk milkfat cheese culture salt sodium tripolyphosphate sodium phosphate calcium phosphate yellow yellow citric acid lactic acid enzyme annie rice pasta cheddar cheddar cheese cultured pasturized milk salt non animal enzyme whey buttermilk salt cream natural flavor natural sodium phosphate annatto extract natural color wiki annatto extract annatto coloring produced reddish pericarp pulp surround seed achiote bixa orellana l used many natural cheese e g cheddar red leicester gouda cheese brie margarine butter rice smoked fish custard powder annie also le sodium sugar grateful also annie make another rice pasta mac cheese deluxe box would compare velveeta lover ooey gooey cheese thicker personally detest velveeta deluxe awesome simple rice pasta cheddar deluxe better macaroni velveeta consistency cheese ridiculous overbearing throat clogging velveeta swear always felt like would suffocate eating stuff definitely recommend product allergy intolerance like looking way significantly reduce heat intake entire family switched kraft product health reason simply prefer taste bit pricey give hint check target occasionally sell annie pasta amazing organic bunny fruit snack go sale quite often purchased rice pasta cheddar box price always kind | . 80000 This drink tastes good.

They are reminicent of a shortbread cookie with a hint of orange and some chewy Crasins thrown in for good measure. Fairly reasonable stats for a cookie (140 calories, 5 grams of total fat and 7 sugars)until you see that is only for THREE cookies. No way you&#39;re going to hold yourself to 3 lousy cookies in one sitting so you&#39;d better plan on doubling that. But it is still a better choice that a lot of offerings in the cookie isle. And that is just where I&#39;d go to purchase these. They didn&#39;t hold up well in shipping and I wound up with a lot of crumbs. Which I ate anyway. Because they were too yummy to let that stop me.

I don&#39;t like being sent a case of canned goods with the cans in the middle of the case crushed. What&#39;s up with that?&lt;br /&gt; I have been satisfied with the condition of other canned goods bought vie Amazon - but buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt; It is not worth my time to complain and return.&lt;br /&gt; But I won&#39;t buy Amy&#39;s soups through Amazon again, and in the future, will REALLY question whether buying ANY canned goods through Amazon is worth it - even if the price is right - considering that the goods may or may not arrive damaged.&lt;br /&gt; Hey Amazon, Honesty is the best policy.

When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent. The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine. When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug&#39;s worth of water, and made a cup. When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk. Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee. For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand. Some other things I love about this brand: it&#39;s organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That&#39;s a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup. The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs. This is a good deal. The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment. | several thing coffee lover look brew aroma color taste look opened individual pack hit wonderful coffee scent pod look typical made pod machine made first cup since aroma strong filled machine good sized mug worth water made cup done color fairly light added small amount milk still flavor bit bland like mild coffee second cup used smaller mug return got darker flavorful cup recommendation brand thing love brand organic sustainably grown fair trade certified lot benefit cent cup even foundation support youth soccer program good deal thing would change individual wrap seems like excess packaging company dedicated environment | . .
