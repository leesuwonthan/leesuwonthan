The convenience of having everything measured and ready to go at a minute&#39;s notice is great. I have a popcorn machine in the media room and so we love to munch popcorn while watching movies.....we feel we are at a theater eating the &quot;real deal&quot;. I will continue to purchase even though it isn&#39;t the most figure friendly popcorn....taste outweighs the waist....tee-he. | 5 | . 2 1327104000 | ses | Makes making baby food super easy! | I love this! I&#39;m a kitchen gadget person and what better than a kitchen gadget for baby? On a serious note, I have been using this for about a month now. I love the all in one thing going on. It makes about 8-12oz with a full basket of fruits or veggies easy to make batches to freeze for later! I have not tried the pasta/rice cooker yet, but will soon. I love how easy it makes making babyfood and is easy to clean up. | 5 | . 3 1311724800 | L. Paul | Good quality food | It&#39;s difficult to review a food when each dogs tastes may vary. This food is a high quality, grain free food. The kibble is small (slightly smaller than ToTW). I moved my dog onto it after she spontaneously decided that she didn&#39;t like ToTW Pacific Stream anymore. Reviews on dogfoodanalysis.com and dogfoodadvisor.com both list the food as a high quality food. I have seen comments on using asorbic acid as a preservative that can lead to bloating if you pre-wet the food. If that&#39;s the case, well, just don&#39;t pre-wet it. My dog is loving this food and has been on it for several months. Her coat and breath are both good. I also add salmon oil and royal jelly to her food, so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the food or not. She also has Antler chews in the house. Either way, I&#39;m just happy that the fussy eater is eating. The subscribe and save option offers about $10 per bag off of the regular price, plus I&#39;m a prime member so I don&#39;t pay shipping. They offer the different flavors in small bags if you&#39;re interested in trying it out before investing in the biggers bags. | 5 | . 4 1325203200 | Sterghe | We love these!! | We&#39;ve now tried not only this item, but also the &quot;mojito&quot; and &quot;appletini&quot; flavors, and they&#39;re all hits in our household! In fact, these are the first drinks I&#39;ve found that get my partner to cut back on the caffeine and sugar and reach for this instead. I personally like the margarita flavor the best of the three, but I also like the real margaritas better than the other two mixed drinks; your opinion may vary. These have now become a staple purchase for our family. | 5 | . ... ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | . 113686 1325462400 | Arctic Highlander | Bitter lime taste | This has a strongly bitter taste of lime when made as directed. Definitely not a natural made from scratch taste. It made the worst tasting Margaritas that I&#39;ve ever had. My initial response is to just pour the rest of it down the drain and cut my losses. I&#39;m glad I only bought one bottle to try. | 1 | . 113687 1252627200 | C. Harr | Everyone loves these taco shells! | Great taste and texture. No one would know these are gluten free. My whole family loves these. I buy them by the case. | 5 | . 113688 1323216000 | Dance Dance Dance | good | I really love Izze because its healthier than other sodas. The only thing I don&#39;t like its that it doesn&#39;t come in two liter size and it is expensive. | 5 | . 113689 1271116800 | Robert W. Doty | Gloria Jean Hazelnut | Never to worry when I run out of my hazlenut creamer, as this coffee is so tasty and so full of hazlenut flavor, that I don&#39;t miss the creamer!&lt;br /&gt;Good service from Amazon to let me know when the order is on its way and always arrives perfectly packed and on time.

He is 16 months now and I still use them. Not all the time, but often. The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain. He won&#39;t eat much when he&#39;s in pain, but these are easy on his gums. They are organic and a quick meal. My son is strong and a very healthy weight. I make sure he gets as much organic, wholesome food as possible. Buying these subscribe and save is a great way to give him good food and still save money.

I love my Keurig, and I don&#39;t mind buying the k-cups. What does bother me is the limited availability of flavored decaf coffees. I am a coffee addict and could drink it all day if it didn&#39;t keep me up all night. I have tried every other do it yourself k cup product out there and they all stink! This product actually works. It brews a decent cup of coffee, not watered down and not a single ground of coffee in the cup. This product is worth the money!

They are not only vegetarian and gluten-free, they have no preservatives. However, while authentic tasting, they are not quite spicy enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;After my young son decided to become a vegetarian, I started ordering this variety pack on a regular basis. Even though the price each is the same as it is in my local store, I can never find all six flavors at the same store at the same time, so it is worth it to order it this way. I serve these over basmati rice, and it&#39;s more than enough to feed two people. | first discovered several year ago trip san francisco rainbow market vegetarian gluten free preservative however authentic tasting quite spicy enough young son decided become vegetarian started ordering variety pack regular basis even though price local store never find six flavor store time worth order way serve basmati rice enough feed two people | . 40000 The description on the 16oz Carousel-Sugarfree Gumball Refill Ordered from Candy Crate Inc. reads it contains a qty. of 900 gumballs. This is a lie- when you recieve this product there are only 114 servings in a bag and the serving size is considered 2 gumballs- this is a total of only 228 gumballs. To get the quantity they are claiming you would actually have to purchase about 4 bags. The gumballs themselves are fine, but beware of the fake description. Hard to write a good review when I feel a little ripped off.

Although This is the best gluten free sour dough bread I have sampled thus far it is much too expensive to pay upwards to $30 for 3 loaves. I have shipped baked goods to military family priority mail for a flat rate of under ten bucks in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Company states they will reduce shipping charges in the future but that doesn&#39;t help me or others currently eager for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality/consistency of this bread, It is fluffy compared to ther bakeries and has not molded after 10 days. It toasts well and easily makes grilled sandwiches delicious. The nutritional content is as follows : 1 slice is 140 calories, no saturated or trans fats, total fat 2 grams. Cholesterol 20 mg, sodium 190 mg, total carb ( for one huge slice ) is 29 grams, fiber 1 gram , sugars 1 gram , protein 2 grams. This has definetly a great sour dough flavor and is not gritty like other gluten free baked goods from other bakeries..I only wish the shipping costs were less with this and all other gluten free baked goods. | updated mixed review due currently outrageous high shipping justify product value although best gluten free sour dough bread sampled thus far much expensive pay upwards loaf shipped baked good military family priority mail flat rate ten buck past company state reduce shipping charge future help others currently eager product quality consistency bread fluffy compared ther bakery molded day toast well easily make grilled sandwich delicious nutritional content follows slice calorie saturated trans fat total fat gram cholesterol mg sodium mg total carb one huge slice gram fiber gram sugar gram protein gram definetly great sour dough flavor gritty like gluten free baked good bakery wish shipping cost le gluten free baked good | . 70000 I don&#39;t have a gluten intolerance - just trying to cut back on the intake of wheat/gluten...and sugar, but that&#39;s another story;) so my body feels less bloated, unhealthy and lethargic due to wheat. With that said, I do know the differences in taste between wheat pastas, rice, quinoa, corn...etc. Personally, I have come to love the taste of non-wheat pastas over wheat, with the exception of corn flour, which isn&#39;t similar enough to wheat to fool my taste buds. Annie&#39;s does a fantastic job with this rice flour product, giving it a consistency and flavor akin to Kraft mac and cheese. What makes this better is the cheese, which tastes far yummier than any boxed mac &amp; cheese I have ever had. Also, it&#39;s real cheese, with as few bizarre ingredients as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like to see ingredients, here is a comparison (and please note I am not a nutritionist - just writing a friendly review:):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese:&lt;br /&gt;Cheese sauce mix ingredients: whey (milk protein), milk protein concentrate, milk, milkfat and cheese culture, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate and calcium phosphate, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid and enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar: cheddar cheese (cultured pasturized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), whey, buttermilk, salt, cream, natural flavor, natural sodium phosphate, annatto extract for natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*wiki annatto extract: Annatto coloring is produced from the reddish pericarp or pulp which surrounds the seed of the achiote (Bixa orellana L.). It is used in many natural cheeses (e.g., Cheddar, Red Leicester, Gouda (cheese) and Brie), margarine, butter, rice, smoked fish, and custard powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s also has less sodium and sugars, which I am grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Annie&#39;s does make another rice pasta mac and cheese - it&#39;s a deluxe box. This is what I would compare to Velveeta - for you lovers out there. It&#39;s the ooey gooey cheese that is thicker. Personally, I detest Velveeta, so the deluxe isn&#39;t as awesome as the simple Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar. But the deluxe IS better than macaroni with Velveeta because the consistency of the cheese isn&#39;t ridiculous overbearing and throat-clogging as Velveeta. I swear, I always felt like I would suffocate eating that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to those with allergies, and intolerance, or those like myself who are looking for ways to significantly reduce heat intake. My entire family has now switched from Kraft over to this product (and they didn&#39;t do it for health reasons - they simply prefer the taste!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a bit more pricey, I&#39;ll give you that. But for a hint - do check Target occasionally. They sell Annie&#39;s pastas and some amazing organic bunny fruit snacks - all of which go on sale quite often (I just purchased Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar for $1 a box!) If only the prices were always so kind;) | gluten intolerance trying cut back intake wheat gluten sugar another story body feel le bloated unhealthy lethargic due wheat said know difference taste wheat pasta rice quinoa corn etc personally come love taste non wheat pasta wheat exception corn flour similar enough wheat fool taste bud annie fantastic job rice flour product giving consistency flavor akin kraft mac cheese make better cheese taste far yummier boxed mac cheese ever also real cheese bizarre ingredient possible like see ingredient comparison please note nutritionist writing friendly review kraft mac cheese cheese sauce mix ingredient whey milk protein milk protein concentrate milk milkfat cheese culture salt sodium tripolyphosphate sodium phosphate calcium phosphate yellow yellow citric acid lactic acid enzyme annie rice pasta cheddar cheddar cheese cultured pasturized milk salt non animal enzyme whey buttermilk salt cream natural flavor natural sodium phosphate annatto extract natural color wiki annatto extract annatto coloring produced reddish pericarp pulp surround seed achiote bixa orellana l used many natural cheese e g cheddar red leicester gouda cheese brie margarine butter rice smoked fish custard powder annie also le sodium sugar grateful also annie make another rice pasta mac cheese deluxe box would compare velveeta lover ooey gooey cheese thicker personally detest velveeta deluxe awesome simple rice pasta cheddar deluxe better macaroni velveeta consistency cheese ridiculous overbearing throat clogging velveeta swear always felt like would suffocate eating stuff definitely recommend product allergy intolerance like looking way significantly reduce heat intake entire family switched kraft product health reason simply prefer taste bit pricey give hint check target occasionally sell annie pasta amazing organic bunny fruit snack go sale quite often purchased rice pasta cheddar box price always kind | . 80000 This drink tastes good. I enjoyed it. I also had my daughter and my grandchildren try it--they drank even more of it and found it pleasant to the taste. Once mixed and cold in the fridge, it didn&#39;t last long.

They are reminicent of a shortbread cookie with a hint of orange and some chewy Crasins thrown in for good measure. Fairly reasonable stats for a cookie (140 calories, 5 grams of total fat and 7 sugars)until you see that is only for THREE cookies. No way you&#39;re going to hold yourself to 3 lousy cookies in one sitting so you&#39;d better plan on doubling that. But it is still a better choice that a lot of offerings in the cookie isle. And that is just where I&#39;d go to purchase these. They didn&#39;t hold up well in shipping and I wound up with a lot of crumbs. Which I ate anyway. Because they were too yummy to let that stop me.

I don&#39;t like being sent a case of canned goods with the cans in the middle of the case crushed. What&#39;s up with that?&lt;br /&gt; I have been satisfied with the condition of other canned goods bought vie Amazon - but buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt; It is not worth my time to complain and return.&lt;br /&gt; But I won&#39;t buy Amy&#39;s soups through Amazon again, and in the future, will REALLY question whether buying ANY canned goods through Amazon is worth it - even if the price is right - considering that the goods may or may not arrive damaged.&lt;br /&gt; Hey Amazon, Honesty is the best policy.

When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent. The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine. When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug&#39;s worth of water, and made a cup. When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk. Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee. For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand. Some other things I love about this brand: it&#39;s organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That&#39;s a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup. The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs. This is a good deal. The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment. | several thing coffee lover look brew aroma color taste look opened individual pack hit wonderful coffee scent pod look typical made pod machine made first cup since aroma strong filled machine good sized mug worth water made cup done color fairly light added small amount milk still flavor bit bland like mild coffee second cup used smaller mug return got darker flavorful cup recommendation brand thing love brand organic sustainably grown fair trade certified lot benefit cent cup even foundation support youth soccer program good deal thing would change individual wrap seems like excess packaging company dedicated environment | .

A short note of what is Word Embedding . Word Embedding Word Embeddings are the texts converted into numbers and there may be different numerical representations of the same text In short, we can say that to build any model in machine learning or deep learning, the final level data has to be in numerical form because models don’t understand text or image data directly as humans do. Therefore, Vectorization or word embedding is the process of converting text data to numerical vectors. Later those vectors are used to build various machine learning models. In this manner, we say this as extracting features with the help of text with an aim to build multiple natural languages, processing models, etc. We have different ways to convert the text data to numerical vectors which we will discuss in this article later. Broadly, we can classified word embeddings into the following two categories: Frequency-based or Statistical based Word Embedding Prediction based Word Embedding . . filter0 = df1[&#39;Score&#39;] == 5 score_5 = df1[filter0] #filter only text_clen which score &lt;4 filter1 = df1[&#39;Score&#39;] &lt; 4 score_1to3 = df1[filter1] . score_5 = score_5[[&#39;Time&#39;,&#39;ProfileName&#39;,&#39;text_clean&#39;,&#39;Score&#39;]].iloc[0:500] #must be in the same shape . score_1to3 = score_1to3[[&#39;Time&#39;,&#39;ProfileName&#39;,&#39;text_clean&#39;,&#39;Score&#39;]].iloc[0:500] #must be in the same shape . tf_score5 = score_5 . score_5 .

He is 16 months now and I still use them. Not all the time, but often. The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain.

They are not only vegetarian and gluten-free, they have no preservatives. However, while authentic tasting, they are not quite spicy enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;After my young son decided to become a vegetarian, I started ordering this variety pack on a regular basis. Even though the price each is the same as it is in my local store, I can never find all six flavors at the same store at the same time, so it is worth it to order it this way. I serve these over basmati rice, and it&#39;s more than enough to feed two people. | first discovered several year ago trip san francisco rainbow market vegetarian gluten free preservative however authentic tasting quite spicy enough young son decided become vegetarian started ordering variety pack regular basis even though price local store never find six flavor store time worth order way serve basmati rice enough feed two people | . 40000 The description on the 16oz Carousel-Sugarfree Gumball Refill Ordered from Candy Crate Inc. reads it contains a qty. of 900 gumballs.

To get the quantity they are claiming you would actually have to purchase about 4 bags. The gumballs themselves are fine, but beware of the fake description.

Although This is the best gluten free sour dough bread I have sampled thus far it is much too expensive to pay upwards to $30 for 3 loaves. I have shipped baked goods to military family priority mail for a flat rate of under ten bucks in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Company states they will reduce shipping charges in the future but that doesn&#39;t help me or others currently eager for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality/consistency of this bread, It is fluffy compared to ther bakeries and has not molded after 10 days. It toasts well and easily makes grilled sandwiches delicious. The nutritional content is as follows : 1 slice is 140 calories, no saturated or trans fats, total fat 2 grams. Cholesterol 20 mg, sodium 190 mg, total carb ( for one huge slice ) is 29 grams, fiber 1 gram , sugars 1 gram , protein 2 grams. This has definetly a great sour dough flavor and is not gritty like other gluten free baked goods from other bakeries..I only wish the shipping costs were less with this and all other gluten free baked goods. | updated mixed review due currently outrageous high shipping justify product value although best gluten free sour dough bread sampled thus far much expensive pay upwards loaf shipped baked good military family priority mail flat rate ten buck past company state reduce shipping charge future help others currently eager product quality consistency bread fluffy compared ther bakery molded day toast well easily make grilled sandwich delicious nutritional content follows slice calorie saturated trans fat total fat gram cholesterol mg sodium mg total carb one huge slice gram fiber gram sugar gram protein gram definetly great sour dough flavor gritty like gluten free baked good bakery wish shipping cost le gluten free baked good | . 70000 I don&#39;t have a gluten intolerance - just trying to cut back on the intake of wheat/gluten...and sugar, but that&#39;s another story;) so my body feels less bloated, unhealthy and lethargic due to wheat. With that said, I do know the differences in taste between wheat pastas, rice, quinoa, corn...etc. Personally, I have come to love the taste of non-wheat pastas over wheat, with the exception of corn flour, which isn&#39;t similar enough to wheat to fool my taste buds. Annie&#39;s does a fantastic job with this rice flour product, giving it a consistency and flavor akin to Kraft mac and cheese. What makes this better is the cheese, which tastes far yummier than any boxed mac &amp; cheese I have ever had. Also, it&#39;s real cheese, with as few bizarre ingredients as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like to see ingredients, here is a comparison (and please note I am not a nutritionist - just writing a friendly review:):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese:&lt;br /&gt;Cheese sauce mix ingredients: whey (milk protein), milk protein concentrate, milk, milkfat and cheese culture, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate and calcium phosphate, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid and enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar: cheddar cheese (cultured pasturized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), whey, buttermilk, salt, cream, natural flavor, natural sodium phosphate, annatto extract for natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*wiki annatto extract: Annatto coloring is produced from the reddish pericarp or pulp which surrounds the seed of the achiote (Bixa orellana L.). It is used in many natural cheeses (e.g., Cheddar, Red Leicester, Gouda (cheese) and Brie), margarine, butter, rice, smoked fish, and custard powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s also has less sodium and sugars, which I am grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Annie&#39;s does make another rice pasta mac and cheese - it&#39;s a deluxe box. This is what I would compare to Velveeta - for you lovers out there. It&#39;s the ooey gooey cheese that is thicker. Personally, I detest Velveeta, so the deluxe isn&#39;t as awesome as the simple Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar. But the deluxe IS better than macaroni with Velveeta because the consistency of the cheese isn&#39;t ridiculous overbearing and throat-clogging as Velveeta. I swear, I always felt like I would suffocate eating that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to those with allergies, and intolerance, or those like myself who are looking for ways to significantly reduce heat intake. My entire family has now switched from Kraft over to this product (and they didn&#39;t do it for health reasons - they simply prefer the taste!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a bit more pricey, I&#39;ll give you that. But for a hint - do check Target occasionally. They sell Annie&#39;s pastas and some amazing organic bunny fruit snacks - all of which go on sale quite often (I just purchased Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar for $1 a box!) If only the prices were always so kind;) | gluten intolerance trying cut back intake wheat gluten sugar another story body feel le bloated unhealthy lethargic due wheat said know difference taste wheat pasta rice quinoa corn etc personally come love taste non wheat pasta wheat exception corn flour similar enough wheat fool taste bud annie fantastic job rice flour product giving consistency flavor akin kraft mac cheese make better cheese taste far yummier boxed mac cheese ever also real cheese bizarre ingredient possible like see ingredient comparison please note nutritionist writing friendly review kraft mac cheese cheese sauce mix ingredient whey milk protein milk protein concentrate milk milkfat cheese culture salt sodium tripolyphosphate sodium phosphate calcium phosphate yellow yellow citric acid lactic acid enzyme annie rice pasta cheddar cheddar cheese cultured pasturized milk salt non animal enzyme whey buttermilk salt cream natural flavor natural sodium phosphate annatto extract natural color wiki annatto extract annatto coloring produced reddish pericarp pulp surround seed achiote bixa orellana l used many natural cheese e g cheddar red leicester gouda cheese brie margarine butter rice smoked fish custard powder annie also le sodium sugar grateful also annie make another rice pasta mac cheese deluxe box would compare velveeta lover ooey gooey cheese thicker personally detest velveeta deluxe awesome simple rice pasta cheddar deluxe better macaroni velveeta consistency cheese ridiculous overbearing throat clogging velveeta swear always felt like would suffocate eating stuff definitely recommend product allergy intolerance like looking way significantly reduce heat intake entire family switched kraft product health reason simply prefer taste bit pricey give hint check target occasionally sell annie pasta amazing organic bunny fruit snack go sale quite often purchased rice pasta cheddar box price always kind | . 80000 This drink tastes good. I enjoyed it. I also had my daughter and my grandchildren try it--they drank even more of it and found it pleasant to the taste. Once mixed and cold in the fridge, it didn&#39;t last long.

They are reminicent of a shortbread cookie with a hint of orange and some chewy Crasins thrown in for good measure. Fairly reasonable stats for a cookie (140 calories, 5 grams of total fat and 7 sugars)until you see that is only for THREE cookies. No way you&#39;re going to hold yourself to 3 lousy cookies in one sitting so you&#39;d better plan on doubling that. But it is still a better choice that a lot of offerings in the cookie isle. And that is just where I&#39;d go to purchase these. They didn&#39;t hold up well in shipping and I wound up with a lot of crumbs. Which I ate anyway. Because they were too yummy to let that stop me.

I don&#39;t like being sent a case of canned goods with the cans in the middle of the case crushed. What&#39;s up with that?&lt;br /&gt; I have been satisfied with the condition of other canned goods bought vie Amazon - but buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt; It is not worth my time to complain and return.&lt;br /&gt; But I won&#39;t buy Amy&#39;s soups through Amazon again, and in the future, will REALLY question whether buying ANY canned goods through Amazon is worth it - even if the price is right - considering that the goods may or may not arrive damaged.&lt;br /&gt; Hey Amazon, Honesty is the best policy.

When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent. The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine. When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug&#39;s worth of water, and made a cup. When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk. Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee. For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand. Some other things I love about this brand: it&#39;s organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That&#39;s a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup. The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs. This is a good deal. The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment. | several thing coffee lover look brew aroma color taste look opened individual pack hit wonderful coffee scent pod look typical made pod machine made first cup since aroma strong filled machine good sized mug worth water made cup done color fairly light added small amount milk still flavor bit bland like mild coffee second cup used smaller mug return got darker flavorful cup recommendation brand thing love brand organic sustainably grown fair trade certified lot benefit cent cup even foundation support youth soccer program good deal thing would change individual wrap seems like excess packaging company dedicated environment | . . ax = df1[&#39;Satisfied&#39;].value_counts().plot(kind=&#39;bar&#39;, figsize=(8,8), title=&quot;Sentiment of Customer Extraced from Restaurant&#39;s reviews&quot;) ax.set_xlabel(&quot;Sentiment of Customer&quot;) ax.set_ylabel(&quot;Frequency&quot;) plt.show() .
