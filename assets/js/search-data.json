Here, I performed sentiment analysis by using a pre-trained model to predict the sentiment that indicate whether the customer being satisfied or not from the service. I will be working with a data set, Amazon Fine Food Reviews, which provide attribute such as review comment, summary, score, profilename etc. With that, I might choose only some atrribute and split them into training set and testing set. In the end, I would show the accuracy rate of my model and some challenge for develop the efficientcy of model in the future.” . toc: true | badges: true | comments: true | categories: [python] | . #import libraries #the dataset: Amazon Fine Food Reviews import pandas as pd import numpy as np import seaborn as sns from wordcloud import WordCloud import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import datetime as dt import datetime import nltk from nltk.corpus import stopwords from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer import re .

I was hoping these would be fresher, closer to the real thing I buy in Mexican markets. Oh well, for a quick snack when you don&#39;t feel like leaving the house, it&#39;s fine. | 3 | . 2 1328659200 | M. Abendroth | One of the best | For those who don&#39;t know, cacao nibs are small pieces of the cacao beans from which chocolate is made. They are roasted much like coffee beans, and even have a somewhat similar nutty flavor, in addition to being chocolatey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like dark chocolate and you like it crunchy with nibs, this is one of the best. It&#39;s like the gourmet version of a Nestle Crunch bar. The nibs are evenly distributed at a density level that adds the perfect crunch without being overbearing, and provides a snap of darkness that contrasts somewhat with the sweetness of the chocolate in which they are embedded. My other favorite from Endangered Species is the 88% dark panther bar. This one is a little sweeter than that, since it&#39;s only 72% cacao, so it should be more palatable to people who find that level of darkness to be a bit too much. | 5 | . 3 1332028800 | Maggie Leave &quot;Maggie H&quot; | This is the best tea I&#39;ve got in the U.S. | Much better than other teas I&#39;ve tried. Real tea lovers would drink loose leaf tea instead of tea bags, and this tea is definitely the best that I&#39;ve ever got. | 5 | . 4 1228521600 | mom 94 &quot;carin&quot; | very dense finished product | I have purchased this item 3 times and have had positive results each time. Though the finished product is very dense and not as sweet as the traditional Jiffy Corn Muffin, if you have gluten intolerance, you will find this to be an adequate replacement. It does offer lactose free directions (a common condition for those recently diagnosed with celiac)which is my usual prep method. The only drawback of the lactose free version is the oil tends to separate from the batter as it bakes, but does not effect the overall quality of the finished product. Leftovers should be refrigerated, and reheated in the microwave for best taste. | 4 | . ... ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | . 113686 1337817600 | Cheryl L.

It&#39;s a keeper. | 5 | . 113687 1137542400 | Lisa Gump &quot;Home CEO&quot; | Wonderful afternoon treat! | I did not buy this from this particular vendor, but I wanted to say this tea is really wonderful. Just as described, it adds a nice vanilla and cream flavor to the earl grey. I like it with a little sugar. I bet it would be good with a little milk as well. | 5 | . 113688 1327190400 | T | Great Food for Multi-Cat Household Also! | I have seven cats and all of them do well with this product. No urinary troubles (one of my males had that issue with a different food). They also seem to vomit a LOT less less often from hairballs, the lack of which I attribute to the change in food. They&#39;ve all been eating it for about a year now. I am back to order more which I do here on Amazon when the price is comparable or less than the local pet store, and I can also get free shipping. | 5 | . 113689 1325808000 | markw | Gorgeous! | I&#39;ve never seen another schilleriana with such beautiful, bold foliage!

He is 16 months now and I still use them. Not all the time, but often. The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain. He won&#39;t eat much when he&#39;s in pain, but these are easy on his gums. They are organic and a quick meal. My son is strong and a very healthy weight. I make sure he gets as much organic, wholesome food as possible. Buying these subscribe and save is a great way to give him good food and still save money.

I love my Keurig, and I don&#39;t mind buying the k-cups. What does bother me is the limited availability of flavored decaf coffees. I am a coffee addict and could drink it all day if it didn&#39;t keep me up all night. I have tried every other do it yourself k cup product out there and they all stink! This product actually works. It brews a decent cup of coffee, not watered down and not a single ground of coffee in the cup. This product is worth the money!

They are not only vegetarian and gluten-free, they have no preservatives. However, while authentic tasting, they are not quite spicy enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;After my young son decided to become a vegetarian, I started ordering this variety pack on a regular basis. Even though the price each is the same as it is in my local store, I can never find all six flavors at the same store at the same time, so it is worth it to order it this way. I serve these over basmati rice, and it&#39;s more than enough to feed two people. | first discovered several year ago trip san francisco rainbow market vegetarian gluten free preservative however authentic tasting quite spicy enough young son decided become vegetarian started ordering variety pack regular basis even though price local store never find six flavor store time worth order way serve basmati rice enough feed two people | . 40000 The description on the 16oz Carousel-Sugarfree Gumball Refill Ordered from Candy Crate Inc. reads it contains a qty. of 900 gumballs. This is a lie- when you recieve this product there are only 114 servings in a bag and the serving size is considered 2 gumballs- this is a total of only 228 gumballs. To get the quantity they are claiming you would actually have to purchase about 4 bags. The gumballs themselves are fine, but beware of the fake description. Hard to write a good review when I feel a little ripped off.

Although This is the best gluten free sour dough bread I have sampled thus far it is much too expensive to pay upwards to $30 for 3 loaves. I have shipped baked goods to military family priority mail for a flat rate of under ten bucks in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Company states they will reduce shipping charges in the future but that doesn&#39;t help me or others currently eager for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality/consistency of this bread, It is fluffy compared to ther bakeries and has not molded after 10 days. It toasts well and easily makes grilled sandwiches delicious. The nutritional content is as follows : 1 slice is 140 calories, no saturated or trans fats, total fat 2 grams. Cholesterol 20 mg, sodium 190 mg, total carb ( for one huge slice ) is 29 grams, fiber 1 gram , sugars 1 gram , protein 2 grams. This has definetly a great sour dough flavor and is not gritty like other gluten free baked goods from other bakeries..I only wish the shipping costs were less with this and all other gluten free baked goods. | updated mixed review due currently outrageous high shipping justify product value although best gluten free sour dough bread sampled thus far much expensive pay upwards loaf shipped baked good military family priority mail flat rate ten buck past company state reduce shipping charge future help others currently eager product quality consistency bread fluffy compared ther bakery molded day toast well easily make grilled sandwich delicious nutritional content follows slice calorie saturated trans fat total fat gram cholesterol mg sodium mg total carb one huge slice gram fiber gram sugar gram protein gram definetly great sour dough flavor gritty like gluten free baked good bakery wish shipping cost le gluten free baked good | . 70000 I don&#39;t have a gluten intolerance - just trying to cut back on the intake of wheat/gluten...and sugar, but that&#39;s another story;) so my body feels less bloated, unhealthy and lethargic due to wheat. With that said, I do know the differences in taste between wheat pastas, rice, quinoa, corn...etc. Personally, I have come to love the taste of non-wheat pastas over wheat, with the exception of corn flour, which isn&#39;t similar enough to wheat to fool my taste buds. Annie&#39;s does a fantastic job with this rice flour product, giving it a consistency and flavor akin to Kraft mac and cheese. What makes this better is the cheese, which tastes far yummier than any boxed mac &amp; cheese I have ever had. Also, it&#39;s real cheese, with as few bizarre ingredients as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like to see ingredients, here is a comparison (and please note I am not a nutritionist - just writing a friendly review:):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese:&lt;br /&gt;Cheese sauce mix ingredients: whey (milk protein), milk protein concentrate, milk, milkfat and cheese culture, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate and calcium phosphate, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid and enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar: cheddar cheese (cultured pasturized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), whey, buttermilk, salt, cream, natural flavor, natural sodium phosphate, annatto extract for natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*wiki annatto extract: Annatto coloring is produced from the reddish pericarp or pulp which surrounds the seed of the achiote (Bixa orellana L.). It is used in many natural cheeses (e.g., Cheddar, Red Leicester, Gouda (cheese) and Brie), margarine, butter, rice, smoked fish, and custard powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s also has less sodium and sugars, which I am grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Annie&#39;s does make another rice pasta mac and cheese - it&#39;s a deluxe box. This is what I would compare to Velveeta - for you lovers out there. It&#39;s the ooey gooey cheese that is thicker. Personally, I detest Velveeta, so the deluxe isn&#39;t as awesome as the simple Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar. But the deluxe IS better than macaroni with Velveeta because the consistency of the cheese isn&#39;t ridiculous overbearing and throat-clogging as Velveeta. I swear, I always felt like I would suffocate eating that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to those with allergies, and intolerance, or those like myself who are looking for ways to significantly reduce heat intake. My entire family has now switched from Kraft over to this product (and they didn&#39;t do it for health reasons - they simply prefer the taste!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a bit more pricey, I&#39;ll give you that. But for a hint - do check Target occasionally. They sell Annie&#39;s pastas and some amazing organic bunny fruit snacks - all of which go on sale quite often (I just purchased Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar for $1 a box!) If only the prices were always so kind;) | gluten intolerance trying cut back intake wheat gluten sugar another story body feel le bloated unhealthy lethargic due wheat said know difference taste wheat pasta rice quinoa corn etc personally come love taste non wheat pasta wheat exception corn flour similar enough wheat fool taste bud annie fantastic job rice flour product giving consistency flavor akin kraft mac cheese make better cheese taste far yummier boxed mac cheese ever also real cheese bizarre ingredient possible like see ingredient comparison please note nutritionist writing friendly review kraft mac cheese cheese sauce mix ingredient whey milk protein milk protein concentrate milk milkfat cheese culture salt sodium tripolyphosphate sodium phosphate calcium phosphate yellow yellow citric acid lactic acid enzyme annie rice pasta cheddar cheddar cheese cultured pasturized milk salt non animal enzyme whey buttermilk salt cream natural flavor natural sodium phosphate annatto extract natural color wiki annatto extract annatto coloring produced reddish pericarp pulp surround seed achiote bixa orellana l used many natural cheese e g cheddar red leicester gouda cheese brie margarine butter rice smoked fish custard powder annie also le sodium sugar grateful also annie make another rice pasta mac cheese deluxe box would compare velveeta lover ooey gooey cheese thicker personally detest velveeta deluxe awesome simple rice pasta cheddar deluxe better macaroni velveeta consistency cheese ridiculous overbearing throat clogging velveeta swear always felt like would suffocate eating stuff definitely recommend product allergy intolerance like looking way significantly reduce heat intake entire family switched kraft product health reason simply prefer taste bit pricey give hint check target occasionally sell annie pasta amazing organic bunny fruit snack go sale quite often purchased rice pasta cheddar box price always kind | . 80000 This drink tastes good. I enjoyed it. I also had my daughter and my grandchildren try it--they drank even more of it and found it pleasant to the taste. Once mixed and cold in the fridge, it didn&#39;t last long.

They are reminicent of a shortbread cookie with a hint of orange and some chewy Crasins thrown in for good measure. Fairly reasonable stats for a cookie (140 calories, 5 grams of total fat and 7 sugars)until you see that is only for THREE cookies. No way you&#39;re going to hold yourself to 3 lousy cookies in one sitting so you&#39;d better plan on doubling that. But it is still a better choice that a lot of offerings in the cookie isle. And that is just where I&#39;d go to purchase these. They didn&#39;t hold up well in shipping and I wound up with a lot of crumbs. Which I ate anyway. Because they were too yummy to let that stop me.

I don&#39;t like being sent a case of canned goods with the cans in the middle of the case crushed. What&#39;s up with that?&lt;br /&gt; I have been satisfied with the condition of other canned goods bought vie Amazon - but buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt; It is not worth my time to complain and return.&lt;br /&gt; But I won&#39;t buy Amy&#39;s soups through Amazon again, and in the future, will REALLY question whether buying ANY canned goods through Amazon is worth it - even if the price is right - considering that the goods may or may not arrive damaged.&lt;br /&gt; Hey Amazon, Honesty is the best policy.

When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent. The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine. When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug&#39;s worth of water, and made a cup. When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk. Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee. For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand. Some other things I love about this brand: it&#39;s organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That&#39;s a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup. The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs. This is a good deal. The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment. | several thing coffee lover look brew aroma color taste look opened individual pack hit wonderful coffee scent pod look typical made pod machine made first cup since aroma strong filled machine good sized mug worth water made cup done color fairly light added small amount milk still flavor bit bland like mild coffee second cup used smaller mug return got darker flavorful cup recommendation brand thing love brand organic sustainably grown fair trade certified lot benefit cent cup even foundation support youth soccer program good deal thing would change individual wrap seems like excess packaging company dedicated environment | .

A short note of what is Word Embedding . Word Embedding Word Embeddings are the texts converted into numbers and there may be different numerical representations of the same text In short, we can say that to build any model in machine learning or deep learning, the final level data has to be in numerical form because models don’t understand text or image data directly as humans do. Therefore, Vectorization or word embedding is the process of converting text data to numerical vectors. Later those vectors are used to build various machine learning models. In this manner, we say this as extracting features with the help of text with an aim to build multiple natural languages, processing models, etc. We have different ways to convert the text data to numerical vectors which we will discuss in this article later. Broadly, we can classified word embeddings into the following two categories: Frequency-based or Statistical based Word Embedding Prediction based Word Embedding . # catagorize reviews into two groups: score 4 and 5, score &lt;= 3 . #filter only text_clen which score = 5 filter0 = df1[&#39;Score&#39;] == 5 score_5 = df1[filter0] #filter only text_clen which score &lt;4 filter1 = df1[&#39;Score&#39;] &lt; 4 score_1to3 = df1[filter1] . score_5 = score_5[[&#39;Time&#39;,&#39;ProfileName&#39;,&#39;text_clean&#39;,&#39;Score&#39;]].iloc[0:500] #must be in the same shape . score_1to3 = score_1to3[[&#39;Time&#39;,&#39;ProfileName&#39;,&#39;text_clean&#39;,&#39;Score&#39;]].iloc[0:500] #must be in the same shape . tf_score5 = score_5 . score_5 .

He is 16 months now and I still use them. Not all the time, but often. The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain.

They are not only vegetarian and gluten-free, they have no preservatives. However, while authentic tasting, they are not quite spicy enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;After my young son decided to become a vegetarian, I started ordering this variety pack on a regular basis. Even though the price each is the same as it is in my local store, I can never find all six flavors at the same store at the same time, so it is worth it to order it this way. I serve these over basmati rice, and it&#39;s more than enough to feed two people. | first discovered several year ago trip san francisco rainbow market vegetarian gluten free preservative however authentic tasting quite spicy enough young son decided become vegetarian started ordering variety pack regular basis even though price local store never find six flavor store time worth order way serve basmati rice enough feed two people | . 40000 The description on the 16oz Carousel-Sugarfree Gumball Refill Ordered from Candy Crate Inc. reads it contains a qty. of 900 gumballs. This is a lie- when you recieve this product there are only 114 servings in a bag and the serving size is considered 2 gumballs- this is a total of only 228 gumballs. To get the quantity they are claiming you would actually have to purchase about 4 bags. The gumballs themselves are fine, but beware of the fake description.

Although This is the best gluten free sour dough bread I have sampled thus far it is much too expensive to pay upwards to $30 for 3 loaves. I have shipped baked goods to military family priority mail for a flat rate of under ten bucks in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Company states they will reduce shipping charges in the future but that doesn&#39;t help me or others currently eager for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality/consistency of this bread, It is fluffy compared to ther bakeries and has not molded after 10 days. It toasts well and easily makes grilled sandwiches delicious. The nutritional content is as follows : 1 slice is 140 calories, no saturated or trans fats, total fat 2 grams. Cholesterol 20 mg, sodium 190 mg, total carb ( for one huge slice ) is 29 grams, fiber 1 gram , sugars 1 gram , protein 2 grams. This has definetly a great sour dough flavor and is not gritty like other gluten free baked goods from other bakeries..I only wish the shipping costs were less with this and all other gluten free baked goods. | updated mixed review due currently outrageous high shipping justify product value although best gluten free sour dough bread sampled thus far much expensive pay upwards loaf shipped baked good military family priority mail flat rate ten buck past company state reduce shipping charge future help others currently eager product quality consistency bread fluffy compared ther bakery molded day toast well easily make grilled sandwich delicious nutritional content follows slice calorie saturated trans fat total fat gram cholesterol mg sodium mg total carb one huge slice gram fiber gram sugar gram protein gram definetly great sour dough flavor gritty like gluten free baked good bakery wish shipping cost le gluten free baked good | . 70000 I don&#39;t have a gluten intolerance - just trying to cut back on the intake of wheat/gluten...and sugar, but that&#39;s another story;) so my body feels less bloated, unhealthy and lethargic due to wheat. With that said, I do know the differences in taste between wheat pastas, rice, quinoa, corn...etc. Personally, I have come to love the taste of non-wheat pastas over wheat, with the exception of corn flour, which isn&#39;t similar enough to wheat to fool my taste buds. Annie&#39;s does a fantastic job with this rice flour product, giving it a consistency and flavor akin to Kraft mac and cheese. What makes this better is the cheese, which tastes far yummier than any boxed mac &amp; cheese I have ever had. Also, it&#39;s real cheese, with as few bizarre ingredients as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like to see ingredients, here is a comparison (and please note I am not a nutritionist - just writing a friendly review:):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese:&lt;br /&gt;Cheese sauce mix ingredients: whey (milk protein), milk protein concentrate, milk, milkfat and cheese culture, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate and calcium phosphate, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid and enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar: cheddar cheese (cultured pasturized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), whey, buttermilk, salt, cream, natural flavor, natural sodium phosphate, annatto extract for natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*wiki annatto extract: Annatto coloring is produced from the reddish pericarp or pulp which surrounds the seed of the achiote (Bixa orellana L.). It is used in many natural cheeses (e.g., Cheddar, Red Leicester, Gouda (cheese) and Brie), margarine, butter, rice, smoked fish, and custard powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie&#39;s also has less sodium and sugars, which I am grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Annie&#39;s does make another rice pasta mac and cheese - it&#39;s a deluxe box. This is what I would compare to Velveeta - for you lovers out there. It&#39;s the ooey gooey cheese that is thicker. Personally, I detest Velveeta, so the deluxe isn&#39;t as awesome as the simple Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar. But the deluxe IS better than macaroni with Velveeta because the consistency of the cheese isn&#39;t ridiculous overbearing and throat-clogging as Velveeta. I swear, I always felt like I would suffocate eating that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to those with allergies, and intolerance, or those like myself who are looking for ways to significantly reduce heat intake. My entire family has now switched from Kraft over to this product (and they didn&#39;t do it for health reasons - they simply prefer the taste!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a bit more pricey, I&#39;ll give you that. But for a hint - do check Target occasionally. They sell Annie&#39;s pastas and some amazing organic bunny fruit snacks - all of which go on sale quite often (I just purchased Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar for $1 a box!) If only the prices were always so kind;) | gluten intolerance trying cut back intake wheat gluten sugar another story body feel le bloated unhealthy lethargic due wheat said know difference taste wheat pasta rice quinoa corn etc personally come love taste non wheat pasta wheat exception corn flour similar enough wheat fool taste bud annie fantastic job rice flour product giving consistency flavor akin kraft mac cheese make better cheese taste far yummier boxed mac cheese ever also real cheese bizarre ingredient possible like see ingredient comparison please note nutritionist writing friendly review kraft mac cheese cheese sauce mix ingredient whey milk protein milk protein concentrate milk milkfat cheese culture salt sodium tripolyphosphate sodium phosphate calcium phosphate yellow yellow citric acid lactic acid enzyme annie rice pasta cheddar cheddar cheese cultured pasturized milk salt non animal enzyme whey buttermilk salt cream natural flavor natural sodium phosphate annatto extract natural color wiki annatto extract annatto coloring produced reddish pericarp pulp surround seed achiote bixa orellana l used many natural cheese e g cheddar red leicester gouda cheese brie margarine butter rice smoked fish custard powder annie also le sodium sugar grateful also annie make another rice pasta mac cheese deluxe box would compare velveeta lover ooey gooey cheese thicker personally detest velveeta deluxe awesome simple rice pasta cheddar deluxe better macaroni velveeta consistency cheese ridiculous overbearing throat clogging velveeta swear always felt like would suffocate eating stuff definitely recommend product allergy intolerance like looking way significantly reduce heat intake entire family switched kraft product health reason simply prefer taste bit pricey give hint check target occasionally sell annie pasta amazing organic bunny fruit snack go sale quite often purchased rice pasta cheddar box price always kind | . 80000 This drink tastes good. I enjoyed it. I also had my daughter and my grandchildren try it--they drank even more of it and found it pleasant to the taste. Once mixed and cold in the fridge, it didn&#39;t last long.

They are reminicent of a shortbread cookie with a hint of orange and some chewy Crasins thrown in for good measure. Fairly reasonable stats for a cookie (140 calories, 5 grams of total fat and 7 sugars)until you see that is only for THREE cookies. No way you&#39;re going to hold yourself to 3 lousy cookies in one sitting so you&#39;d better plan on doubling that. But it is still a better choice that a lot of offerings in the cookie isle. And that is just where I&#39;d go to purchase these. They didn&#39;t hold up well in shipping and I wound up with a lot of crumbs. Which I ate anyway. Because they were too yummy to let that stop me.

I don&#39;t like being sent a case of canned goods with the cans in the middle of the case crushed. What&#39;s up with that?&lt;br /&gt; I have been satisfied with the condition of other canned goods bought vie Amazon - but buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt; It is not worth my time to complain and return.&lt;br /&gt; But I won&#39;t buy Amy&#39;s soups through Amazon again, and in the future, will REALLY question whether buying ANY canned goods through Amazon is worth it - even if the price is right - considering that the goods may or may not arrive damaged.&lt;br /&gt; Hey Amazon, Honesty is the best policy.

When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent. The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine. When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug&#39;s worth of water, and made a cup. When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk. Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee. For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand. Some other things I love about this brand: it&#39;s organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That&#39;s a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup. The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs. This is a good deal. The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment. | several thing coffee lover look brew aroma color taste look opened individual pack hit wonderful coffee scent pod look typical made pod machine made first cup since aroma strong filled machine good sized mug worth water made cup done color fairly light added small amount milk still flavor bit bland like mild coffee second cup used smaller mug return got darker flavorful cup recommendation brand thing love brand organic sustainably grown fair trade certified lot benefit cent cup even foundation support youth soccer program good deal thing would change individual wrap seems like excess packaging company dedicated environment | . #showing the proportion of our review catagorized by &#39;satisfied&#39; and &#39;not satisfied&#39; labels . ax = df1[&#39;Satisfied&#39;].value_counts().plot(kind=&#39;bar&#39;, figsize=(8,8), title=&quot;Sentiment of Customer Extraced from Restaurant&#39;s reviews&quot;) ax.set_xlabel(&quot;Sentiment of Customer&quot;) ax.set_ylabel(&quot;Frequency&quot;) plt.show() . .

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive.
